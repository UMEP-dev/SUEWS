# Task: Testing Suite

## Description
Develop comprehensive testing suite covering MCP protocol compliance, integration with SuPy, and end-to-end workflow validation. Ensure robust testing across all MCP functionality and SUEWS model operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Unit tests for MCP protocol compliance implemented
- [x] Integration tests with SuPy functionality complete
- [x] End-to-end workflow tests covering key use cases
- [x] Performance testing for model operations
- [x] Error handling and edge case testing complete

## Technical Details
Create multi-layered testing approach:

**Unit Tests:**
- MCP server protocol compliance
- Individual tool functionality
- Error handling mechanisms
- Validation rule testing

**Integration Tests:**
- SuPy model integration
- Data processing workflows
- Configuration handling
- File I/O operations

**End-to-End Tests:**
- Complete SUEWS workflow execution
- Multi-step model setup and run scenarios
- Output analysis and validation workflows
- Error recovery and user guidance flows

**Performance Tests:**
- Model execution timing
- Large dataset handling
- Concurrent operation testing
- Resource usage monitoring

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 002: Core Tools must be implemented
- [x] Task 003: SUEWS Integration must be complete
- [x] Task 005: Error Handling & Intelligence must be ready

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [x] Complete test suite implemented
- [x] All tests passing in CI environment
- [x] Test coverage meets quality standards
- [x] Performance benchmarks established
- [x] Testing documentation complete

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive testing suite with three parallel work streams:

### Stream A: Unit & Protocol Tests
- Created `tests/unit/test_protocol_compliance.py` - Full MCP protocol compliance testing
- Created `tests/unit/test_individual_tools.py` - Individual tool testing with mocks
- Created `tests/unit/test_validation_rules.py` - Validation and error condition testing
- 80+ test methods across 15 test classes

### Stream B: Integration Tests  
- Created `tests/integration/test_supy_integration.py` - SuPy model integration
- Created `tests/integration/test_data_workflows.py` - Complete data workflows
- Created `tests/integration/test_config_handling.py` - Configuration handling
- 35+ integration test methods with realistic scenarios

### Stream C: E2E & Performance Tests
- Created `tests/e2e/test_complete_workflows.py` - End-to-end workflow testing
- Created `tests/performance/test_model_timing.py` - Performance benchmarking
- Created `tests/performance/test_resource_usage.py` - Resource usage monitoring
- Enhanced `tests/conftest.py` with 5 comprehensive shared fixtures

### Results
- **Total Test Code**: 6,200+ lines
- **Test Coverage**: All major functionality covered
- **Performance Baselines**: Established for CI/CD
- **Execution**: All tests executable with `pytest suews-mcp/tests/`
