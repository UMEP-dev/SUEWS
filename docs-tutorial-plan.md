- **Current coverage**: Basic visualization in quick-start tutorial
- **Missing**: Advanced visualization techniques, comprehensive statistical calculations, comparative analysis methods

### Issue #155: How to design simulation scenarios  
- **Status**: Partially covered
- **Current coverage**: Brief climate scenario example in workflow.rst
- **Missing**: Background climate design, surface characteristic modifications, human activity parameterization

### Issue #156: How to prepare initial conditions
- **Status**: Not comprehensively covered
- **Current coverage**: Parameter documentation exists
- **Missing**: Practical guidance on phenology initialization, surface wetness state preparation

### Issue #157: How to prepare surface characteristics data
- **Status**: Partially covered
- **Current coverage**: Parameter documentation exists
- **Missing**: Practical methods for albedo determination, morphology data collection, LAI estimation, OHM coefficient derivation, surface conductance parameterization
