# Task: Error Handling & Intelligence

## Description
Implement smart error diagnosis and helpful error messages with actionable suggestions. Create validation rules that catch common SUEWS configuration and data issues before they cause model failures, providing intelligent guidance for resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Intelligent error diagnosis system implemented
- [ ] Context-aware error messages with suggestions
- [ ] Pre-flight validation rules for SUEWS configurations
- [ ] Common error pattern recognition and guidance
- [ ] Integration with existing SuPy error handling

## Technical Details
Build comprehensive error handling that understands SUEWS-specific issues:
- Parse and interpret SuPy/SUEWS error messages
- Implement validation rules for common configuration mistakes
- Create diagnostic tools for data quality issues
- Provide suggested fixes for known error patterns
- Integrate with MCP protocol error responses

Key areas to cover:
- Configuration file validation
- Forcing data format checking
- Physics option compatibility validation
- Common parameter value range checking
- File path and dependency validation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Core Tools must be implemented
- [ ] Task 003: SUEWS Integration must be complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Error handling system implemented
- [ ] Validation rules created and tested
- [ ] Error message templates with suggestions ready
- [ ] Integration with existing error systems complete
- [ ] Error handling documented and tested
