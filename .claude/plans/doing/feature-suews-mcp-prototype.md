# Feature: SUEWS MCP Prototype

## Lead Developer
- **GitHub**: @sunt05
- **Started**: 2025-06-28

## Context
Create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for SUEWS that provides intelligent configuration guidance and result interpretation. This will help users create scientifically sound model configurations and understand their simulation outputs.

## GitHub Issues
- No specific issue yet (prototype development)

## Status
- **Current**: doing
- **Outcome**: pending
- **Completed**: [pending]
- **PR**: [pending]

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Create worktree and dedicated environment
- [x] Set up basic MCP server structure
- [x] Install MCP Python SDK
- [x] Create project structure with tools/resources directories

### Phase 2: Core Integration
- [x] Build bridge to existing SUEWS pydantic models
- [x] Implement basic configuration validation tool
- [x] Test validation with example configuration
- [x] Create error parsing and reporting system

### Phase 3: Configuration Guidance Tools (COMPLETED ✅)
- [x] Implement `validate_config` tool
- [x] Create `suggest_parameters` tool
- [x] Build `check_physics_compatibility` tool (comprehensive compatibility matrix)
- [x] Develop `generate_config_template` tool (site & research specific templates)
- [x] Add `explain_parameter` tool (comprehensive knowledge base implemented)

### Phase 4: Result Interpretation Tools (COMPLETED ✅)
- [x] Implement `diagnose_energy_balance` tool (with closure analysis and issue detection)
- [x] Create `interpret_thermal_comfort` tool (Humidex, WBGT, PET, health implications)
- [x] Build `analyze_urban_effects` tool (UHI analysis, cooling potential)
- [x] Develop `validate_against_observations` tool (comprehensive metrics, temporal patterns)
- [x] Add `generate_insights_report` tool (context-aware narrative reports)

### Phase 5: Knowledge Base (COMPLETED ✅)
- [x] Create parameter documentation database (PARAMETER_KNOWLEDGE dict)
- [x] Build physics method compatibility matrix (COMPATIBILITY_RULES)
- [x] Add typical value ranges by climate (in parameter knowledge)
- [x] Implement interpretation rules engine (in each analyzer)
- [x] Include literature reference values (thresholds and recommendations)

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Test with Claude Desktop integration
- [x] Create example workflows (demo.py)
- [ ] Write user documentation
- [ ] Add performance optimisations

## Key Decisions
- Use Python MCP SDK for implementation
- Leverage existing pydantic validation infrastructure
- Create modular tool architecture for extensibility
- Focus on scientific accuracy and user guidance
- Use FastMCP for improved developer experience

## Implementation Notes
- Bridge to SUEWS data models via `src/supy/data_model/`
- Use `ValidationController` for conditional validation logic
- Implement smart suggestions based on urban context
- Provide clear scientific explanations for all guidance
- Each tool is self-contained with domain expertise

## Files Created
- `worktrees/suews-mcp/mcp-server/` (main directory) ✅
- `worktrees/suews-mcp/mcp-server/src/server.py` (MCP server) ✅
- `worktrees/suews-mcp/mcp-server/src/tools/` (11 tool modules) ✅
- `worktrees/suews-mcp/mcp-server/src/utils/suews_bridge.py` (SUEWS integration) ✅
- `worktrees/suews-mcp/mcp-server/manifest.json` (desktop extension) ✅
- `worktrees/suews-mcp/mcp-server/pyproject.toml` (project config) ✅
- `worktrees/suews-mcp/mcp-server/README.md` (documentation) ✅

## Testing Strategy
- Test desktop extension with Claude Desktop
- Create example workflows for common use cases
- Validate scientific accuracy of all tools
- Performance testing with large configurations

## Documentation Updates
- User guide for MCP server usage
- API documentation for each tool
- Configuration examples for different urban contexts
- Video demonstrations of key features

## Current Status (2025-07-11)
- Worktree at `worktrees/suews-mcp` fully implemented
- Environment using venv (via uv for fast setup)
- MCP server with FastMCP complete
- ALL tools implemented and tested with scientific accuracy:
  - Configuration: validation, suggestions, physics compatibility, templates, parameter explanations
  - Results: energy balance, thermal comfort, urban effects, validation, insights
- Desktop extension (.dxt) freshly built: `suews-assistant-20250711.dxt`
- Comprehensive knowledge base integrated
- All tools enabled and tested successfully
- Ready for Claude Desktop integration testing

## Next Steps
1. Test desktop extension with Claude Desktop
2. Create video demonstrations
3. Write comprehensive user guide
4. Performance optimization if needed
5. Prepare for release/publication

## Desktop Extension
- Created manifest.json with tool descriptions and configuration
- Built .dxt package (suews-assistant-YYYYMMDD.dxt)
- Ready for one-click installation in Claude Desktop
- Simplifies testing and distribution to end users
