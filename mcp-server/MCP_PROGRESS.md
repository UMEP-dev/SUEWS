## MCP Server Progress

### Completed
- ✅ Created all 10 MCP tools for SUEWS configuration and analysis
- ✅ Built desktop extension (DXT) package 
- ✅ Fixed manifest.json for Claude Desktop compatibility
- ✅ Made SuPy a required dependency (v2025.6.2.dev)
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect SuPy requirement
- ✅ Rebuilt extension without bundled SuPy (now 81.4 KB)

### Next Steps for Testing
1. Install SuPy in the system Python environment:
   `pip install supy==2025.6.2.dev`
   
2. Test the MCP server locally:
   `python -m suews_mcp.server`
   
3. Install the desktop extension:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Go to Extensions
   - Install dist/suews-assistant-20250629.dxt
   
### Notes
- SuPy is now enforced as a dependency
- Extension requires users to have SuPy installed
- All validation features depend on SuPy data models
