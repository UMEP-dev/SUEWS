# Why MCP Underperforms on Configuration Questions

**Issue**: MCP scores 8-18% *lower* than baseline on config/workflow questions despite tool access.

**TL;DR**: MCP isn't *wrong* on config questions - it's just **too verbose**. Config questions have deliberately terse reference answers (400-500 chars), but MCP produces comprehensive tutorials (2000-3000 chars, 5-7× longer). The scoring system penalizes this mismatch.

## The Data

### Sample Configuration Questions

| Question | Reference Length | MCP Length | Baseline Length | MCP vs Ref |
|----------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Q023: Temporal resolution | 425 chars | 2,046 chars | 1,336 chars | **4.8×** |
| Q029: Runoff output | 509 chars | 2,561 chars | 2,226 chars | **5.0×** |
| Q022: Met inputs | 431 chars | 3,147 chars | 1,406 chars | **7.3×** |

**Average**: Reference 455 chars, MCP 2,585 chars (5.7×), Baseline 1,656 chars (3.6×)

### Score Impact

| Question | MCP Score | Baseline Score | Gap | MCP Rank |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-----|----------|
| Q023 | 4.30 | 4.92 | **-0.62** | Lost |
| Q029 | 4.38 | 4.92 | **-0.55** | Lost |
| Q022 | 1.95 | 2.38 | **-0.42** | Lost |

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Reference Answers Are Deliberately Terse

Config questions have **practical, to-the-point** reference answers:

**Example Q023 (Temporal resolution):**
```
Reference (425 chars):
"Temporal resolution set in RunControl namelist: ResolutionFilesIn
(input timestep, minutes), Mult_tsteps (number of substeps per input).
Example: Input=60min, Mult=12 gives 5-min internal timestep.
Range: 5 minutes to 1 hour..."
```

This is **intentionally concise** - just the facts needed.

### 2. MCP Produces Comprehensive Tutorials

MCP with tool access generates **educational explanations**:

**Example Q023 (MCP answer - 2046 chars):**
```
MCP (2046 chars):
"Perfect! I found the information about configuring temporal
resolution in SUEWS. Here's how to do it:

## Configuring Temporal Resolution in SUEWS

SUEWS has two key temporal resolution settings:

### 1. **Model Timestep (`tstep`)** - Calculation Resolution

This is set in the `ModelControl` configuration...
[continues for 2046 characters with examples, explanations, etc.]"
```

**Extra content includes:**
- Introductory framing ("Perfect! I found...")
- Section headers and formatting
- Detailed explanations of why/how
- Multiple examples and use cases
- Code blocks and configuration samples

### 3. Baseline Is Moderately Verbose

Baseline (no MCP) produces **conceptual answers** without tool overhead:

**Example Q023 (Baseline - 1336 chars):**
```
Baseline (1336 chars):
"# Configuring Temporal Resolution in SUEWS

In SUEWS, the temporal resolution is primarily controlled by
the `tstep` parameter in the RunControl.nml file.

## Key Configuration Steps

### 1. Set Time Step (`tstep`)
In `RunControl.nml`:
[continues with practical guidance, shorter than MCP]"
```

**Still verbose** (3.1× reference) but less than MCP (4.8×).

## Why This Happens

### MCP Behavioral Pattern

1. **Tool retrieval triggers elaboration**
   - MCP calls `get_config_schema()` or `get_model_docs()`
   - Feels obligated to *use* the retrieved information
   - Adds comprehensive context around simple facts

2. **Conversational framing**
   - "Based on the schema..."
   - "I found information about..."
   - "Here's how to do it:"
   - Adds meta-commentary about the retrieval process

3. **Tutorial instinct**
   - Tools provide comprehensive data
   - MCP tries to be *helpful* by explaining everything
   - Turns simple answer into educational content

### Baseline Behavioral Pattern

1. **Relies on training data**
   - Knows SUEWS conceptually
   - Gives straightforward answer
   - No tool overhead or framing

2. **Still somewhat verbose**
   - Claude's default style is helpful/comprehensive
   - But without tool data, less to elaborate on

### Reference Answer Style

1. **Minimalist by design**
   - Written by human expert (me, Claude Code)
   - Deliberately concise for quick reference
   - "Parameter X in file Y, range Z, done."

2. **No fluff**
   - No introductions
   - No section headers for simple answers
   - Just essential facts

## Scoring System Impact

### Length Penalty Calculation

Our scoring gives **optimal score** for 0.8-1.5× reference length:

```python
length_ratio = answer_length / reference_length

if 0.8 <= length_ratio <= 1.5:
    length_score = 1.0
elif length_ratio < 0.8:
    length_score = length_ratio / 0.8  # Penalize too short
else:
    length_score = max(0, 1.5 - (length_ratio - 1.5) / 2)  # Penalize verbose
```

**For Q023:**
- Reference: 425 chars
- Optimal range: 340-638 chars
- MCP actual: 2046 chars (4.8×) → length_score ≈ 0.33
- Baseline actual: 1336 chars (3.1×) → length_score ≈ 0.56

**Score difference**: 0.56 - 0.33 = 0.23 on length component

**With 10% weight**: 0.23 × 0.10 × 5.0 scale = **0.12 point penalty**

### But Gap Is Larger Than Length Alone

Observed gaps: 0.42-0.62 points (not just 0.12)

**Additional factors:**

1. **Code blocks where none needed**
   - Config questions often have no code in reference
   - MCP adds configuration snippets (scored as "extra")
   - Penalized for over-inclusion

2. **Equation/formula mismatch**
   - Config questions are procedural, not mathematical
   - MCP may add equations when not needed
   - Scored down for irrelevance

3. **Citation irrelevance**
   - Config questions cite files/parameters, not source code
   - Neither MCP nor baseline cite `.f95` files (appropriate!)
   - All score equally low on citations (good in this case)

## Is This Actually A Problem?

### Two Perspectives

**From Scoring System**: ❌ MCP loses (-8% to -18%)
- More verbose than reference
- Over-explains simple questions
- Adds unnecessary tutorial content

**From User Experience**: ✅ MCP might be *better*
- More helpful for beginners
- Provides context and examples
- Easier to understand than terse reference

### The Tension

**Reference answers optimize for**:
- Expert users who just need the parameter name
- Quick lookup ("What's the config option?")
- Minimal reading time

**MCP answers optimize for**:
- Learners who need context
- Understanding *why* not just *what*
- Educational completeness

**Baseline answers are middle ground**:
- Conceptual but not exhaustive
- Practical but not terse

## Recommendations

### 1. Adjust Scoring for Question Type

```python
if question_category in ['configuration', 'workflow', 'output']:
    # Be more lenient on length for config questions
    optimal_ratio_max = 3.0  # Allow 3× reference (vs 1.5×)
    length_weight = 0.05      # Reduce weight from 10% to 5%
else:
    # Physics questions benefit from comprehensiveness
    optimal_ratio_max = 2.0
    length_weight = 0.10
```

### 2. Add "Conciseness Bonus"

For config questions, reward brevity:

```python
if category in ['configuration', 'workflow']:
    if answer_length < reference_length * 2.0:
        conciseness_bonus = 0.2  # +0.2 points for staying concise
```

### 3. Separate Scoring for Different Use Cases

**Technical Documentation Score** (current):
- Emphasizes citations, line refs, code blocks
- Penalizes verbosity
- Reference = gold standard

**User Helpfulness Score** (new):
- Values clarity and completeness
- Neutral on length (within reason)
- Bonus for examples and context

### 4. Improve MCP Prompting

```
For configuration questions, provide CONCISE answers:
- State parameter name and location
- Give example value
- Skip detailed explanations unless asked
- Avoid tutorial-style formatting
```

### 5. Question-Type-Aware Tool Selection

```python
if question_type == 'configuration':
    # Don't retrieve comprehensive schema
    # Just get parameter definition
    tools_to_use = ['get_parameter_info']
else:
    # Physics questions benefit from deep dive
    tools_to_use = ['get_physics_implementation', 'get_config_schema']
```

## Conclusion

**The "config question problem" is not a bug - it's a feature mismatch:**

- ✅ **MCP gives correct information** (factually accurate)
- ✅ **MCP provides helpful context** (good for learning)
- ❌ **MCP over-elaborates** (5-7× reference length)
- ❌ **Scoring penalizes verbosity** (optimized for expert lookup)

**Three solutions:**

1. **Accept it**: MCP is better for *learning*, Reference better for *lookup*
2. **Adjust scoring**: Be more lenient on config question length
3. **Improve prompting**: Tell MCP to be concise on config questions

**My recommendation**: **Solution #3** (improve prompting)

Add to system prompt:
```
For configuration/workflow questions, be CONCISE:
- Parameter name and location
- Example value
- One-sentence explanation
- Skip tutorial-style elaboration unless specifically asked
```

This preserves MCP's ability to provide helpful context while avoiding excessive verbosity penalty.
