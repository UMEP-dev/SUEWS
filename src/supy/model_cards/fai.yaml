  category: boundary_layer
  purpose: >-
    Controls how the frontal area index (FAI) is determined: from user-provided
    values or calculated from surface fractions and element heights.

    Frontal area index is the ratio of the windward frontal area of roughness
    elements to the plan area, and is a key input to morphometric roughness
    methods (MacDonald) and roughness sublayer corrections. Method 0 uses
    FAI values provided directly in the site parameters (FAIBldg, FAIEveTree,
    FAIDecTree). Method 1 estimates FAI using a simple scheme based on
    surface fractions and element heights.

evaluation_evidence:
  evaluation_status: internal
  performance_summary: >-
    The simple FAI estimation scheme provides reasonable values for typical
    urban morphologies but should be verified against morphometric databases
    where available.

  configuration_notes: >-
    FAIMethod=0 uses user-provided FAI values. FAIMethod=1 estimates FAI from
    surface fractions and heights using a simple scheme. Method 0 is preferred
    when morphometric data are available.
