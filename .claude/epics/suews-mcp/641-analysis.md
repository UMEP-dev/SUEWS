# Task #641: Testing Suite - Parallel Work Analysis

## Overview
Create comprehensive testing suite for the SUEWS MCP server covering unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end workflows, and performance testing.

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Unit & Protocol Tests (test-unit)
**Files to create/modify:**
- `suews-mcp/tests/unit/test_protocol_compliance.py`
- `suews-mcp/tests/unit/test_individual_tools.py`
- `suews-mcp/tests/unit/test_validation_rules.py`

**Work:**
1. Test MCP protocol compliance (initialize, list_tools, call_tool)
2. Test each tool individually with mock data
3. Test validation rules and error conditions
4. Test handler methods and responses

**Agent type:** general-purpose

### Stream B: Integration Tests (test-integration)
**Files to create/modify:**
- `suews-mcp/tests/integration/test_supy_integration.py`
- `suews-mcp/tests/integration/test_data_workflows.py`
- `suews-mcp/tests/integration/test_config_handling.py`

**Work:**
1. Test SuPy model integration with real data
2. Test complete data processing workflows
3. Test configuration file handling and validation
4. Test file I/O operations and format conversions

**Agent type:** general-purpose

### Stream C: End-to-End & Performance Tests (test-e2e)
**Files to create/modify:**
- `suews-mcp/tests/e2e/test_complete_workflows.py`
- `suews-mcp/tests/performance/test_model_timing.py`
- `suews-mcp/tests/performance/test_resource_usage.py`
- `suews-mcp/tests/conftest.py` (update fixtures)

**Work:**
1. Test complete SUEWS workflows from setup to analysis
2. Test multi-step scenarios with error recovery
3. Test performance with large datasets
4. Create shared fixtures and utilities

**Agent type:** general-purpose

## Execution Strategy
All three streams can work in parallel as they focus on different test categories:
- Stream A focuses on unit-level MCP protocol testing
- Stream B focuses on integration with SuPy components  
- Stream C focuses on complete workflows and performance

## Coordination Points
- All streams should use consistent test data from `suews-mcp/tests/fixtures/`
- Coordinate on shared test utilities in `conftest.py`
- Follow existing test patterns from completed tasks

## Success Metrics
- 80%+ code coverage across all modules
- All tests pass in < 60 seconds
- Performance tests establish baseline metrics
- Clear test documentation and examples
