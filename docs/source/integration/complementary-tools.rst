Complementary Interfaces and Tools
===================================

SUEWS integrates with urban climate modelling tools and platforms that provide complementary functionality to the core Python interface.

.. note::

   **SuPy** is the primary modern interface for SUEWS and is documented throughout this manual. The tools below provide additional capabilities for specific workflows and use cases.

Graphical Interfaces
--------------------

**UMEP (Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor)**

UMEP provides a comprehensive QGIS-based interface for SUEWS with particular strengths in:

- **Spatial analysis**: Grid-based simulations and spatial data processing
- **GIS integration**: Direct integration with QGIS spatial analysis tools
- **Pre/post-processing**: Sophisticated tools for data preparation and visualisation
- **Workflow automation**: Graphical interface for complex spatial modelling workflows
