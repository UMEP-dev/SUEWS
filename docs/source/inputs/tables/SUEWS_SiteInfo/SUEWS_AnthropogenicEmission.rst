.. note::

    .. versionchanged:: v2019a
        this file is renamed from ``SUEWS_AnthropogenicHeat.txt`` (prior to v2019a) to include more emission related settings.


`SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt` provides the parameters needed to model the anthropogenic heat flux using either the method of :cite:t:`L11` based on air temperature (`EmissionsMethod` = 1 in `RunControl.nml`) or the method of :cite:t:`J11` based on heating and cooling degree days (`EmissionsMethod` = 2 in `RunControl.nml`).

For the method of :cite:t:`J11` (`EmissionsMethod` = 2 in `RunControl.nml`), one can further configure the scheme for calculting :term:`HDD`/ :term:`CDD` via `BaseTMethod` in `RunControl.nml`:

- `BaseTMethod` = 1 ("V-shape" approach): a single `BaseT_HC` is used by omitting the comfort range where neither heating nor cooling is activated.

- `BaseTMethod` = 2 ("U-shape" approach): `TCritic_Heating_WD` (`TCritic_Heating_WE`) and `TCritic_Cooling_WD` (`TCritic_Cooling_WE`) are used for HDD and CDD calculations in weekdays (weekends), respectively, which allows a comfort range between `TCritic_Heating_WD` (`TCritic_Heating_WE`) and `TCritic_Cooling_WD` (`TCritic_Cooling_WE`).


The sub-daily variation in anthropogenic heat flux is modelled according to the daily cycles specified in `SUEWS_Profiles.txt`.

Alternatively, if available, the anthropogenic heat flux can be provided in the met forcing file (and set `EmissionsMethod` = 0 in `RunControl.nml`) by filling the :option:`qf` column with valid values.
