  full_name: Uniform Wall/Roof Albedo Assumption
  category: radiation
  purpose: >-
    Controls whether all walls (or roofs) within the urban canopy share the
    same albedo value, simplifying the radiation calculation for multi-layer
    schemes.

  enum_class: SameAlbedoWall
  enum_values: [0, 1]

scientific_basis:
  theoretical_basis: >-
    When enabled, all wall (or roof) surfaces in the multi-layer urban canopy
    are assigned the same albedo value. This simplifies the radiation transfer
    calculation in SPARTACUS-Surface by reducing the number of unique surface
    property combinations. Two separate enums control walls (SameAlbedoWall)
    and roofs (SameAlbedoRoof) independently.

  key_assumptions:
    - "Albedo variation between walls (or roofs) at different levels is negligible"

evaluation_evidence:
  evaluation_status: internal
  performance_summary: >-
    Internal setting primarily used with SPARTACUS-Surface multi-layer
    radiation. Reduces complexity when vertical variation in surface
    optical properties is not important.

  configuration_notes: >-
    SameAlbedoWall=1 applies a uniform wall albedo across all layers.
    SameAlbedoRoof=1 applies a uniform roof albedo. Both default to 0
    (allowing per-layer variation). Primarily relevant when using
    SPARTACUS-Surface (NetRadiationMethod 1001-1003).
