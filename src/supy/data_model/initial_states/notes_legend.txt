SUEWS Parameter Analysis - Notes Legend
========================================

Temperature-Related Notes (1-9):
--------------------------------
1. These parameters are assigned with 2m monthly mean air temperature during precheck procedure.
Monthly mean air temperature is obtained from CRU TS Version 4.06 dataset (reference: 
https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_4.06/).
    1.1. Future improvements will implement a 5 days avg air temperature assignment.

2. Snow and ice parameters that are updated according to monthly mean air temperature, lat and lng
(see note 1). If monthly mean air temperature > 4C°, these should be set to 0.

3. Snow and ice parameters that are updated according to monthly mean air temperature, lat and lng
(see note 1). If monthly mean air temperature < 4C°, these should be set to reasonable values. 
[SG suggested: ask Lena for suggestions].

4. Parameters related to degree days.

5. [Available for temperature-related note assignment]

6. [Available for temperature-related note assignment]
