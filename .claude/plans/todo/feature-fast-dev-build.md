# Feature: Fast Development Build System

## Lead Developer
- **GitHub**: @sunt05
- **Started**: 2025-06-27

## Context
This branch focuses on creating a fast development build system and comprehensive documentation overhaul. The goal is to improve developer productivity by reducing build times and enhancing documentation quality and accessibility.

## GitHub Issues
- #411 - Clean-up and content revision of the 2025 docs system (PRIMARY) - CLOSED but active work
- #343 - Update docs site - CLOSED but ongoing
- #365 - Add an interactive editor for SUEWS config - CLOSED but enhance
- #328 - v2025 release - to check (release-checklist)

## Status
- **Current**: todo
- **Outcome**: pending

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Documentation Structure Overhaul
- [x] Forcing data preparation guide
- [x] Enhanced component documentation
- [x] Integration of output file documentation
- [x] Configuration builder improvements

### Phase 2: Fast Build System Implementation
- [ ] Create development-only build targets
- [ ] Implement incremental compilation
- [ ] Add build caching system
- [ ] Create quick-test targets

### Phase 3: Documentation Enhancements (ongoing)
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Add interactive examples
- [ ] Improve search functionality
- [ ] Add version switcher

### Phase 4: Developer Tooling
- [ ] Hot-reload for documentation
- [ ] Automated API doc generation
- [ ] Build performance profiling
- [ ] Development environment setup scripts

## Key Decisions
- **Build System**: Separate development and production build paths
- **Build Tools**: Use modern build tools for faster compilation
- **Dependencies**: Implement proper dependency tracking
- **Workflow**: Focus on iterative development workflow

## Implementation Notes
- This branch already has significant documentation work
- Build system improvements should complement doc work
- Consider using ccache for Fortran compilation
- Implement parallel builds where possible
- Documentation should auto-build on changes
- **[2025-06-27 Update]**: Demonstrated plan update workflow from worktree
- **Note**: Plans are accessible via `../../.claude-plans/` from worktree directories
- **Session Note**: Added workflow documentation for Claude Code plan updates

## Files to Modify
- `Makefile` - Add fast development targets
- `meson.build` - Optimise build configuration
- `docs/Makefile` - Add watch/hot-reload targets
- `docs/source/conf.py` - Documentation enhancements
- `.github/workflows/` - CI optimisations
- Development setup scripts (new)

## Build Performance Goals
1. < 5 second incremental builds
2. < 30 second full rebuild
3. < 2 second documentation preview
4. Parallel test execution
5. Cached dependency builds

## Documentation Goals
1. Comprehensive API reference
2. Interactive configuration examples
3. Video tutorials integration
4. Improved navigation and search
5. Mobile-responsive design

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for build system components
- Integration tests for documentation generation
- Performance benchmarks for build times
- Manual testing of hot-reload functionality

## Documentation Updates
- Developer guide for fast build system
- API documentation automation guide
- Configuration builder usage guide
- v2025 release notes

## Current Development Notes
This branch is actively developed with extensive documentation improvements already in place. Focus should be on:
1. Completing the documentation overhaul
2. Implementing the fast build system
3. Preparing for v2025 release
