# Task: Testing Suite

## Description
Develop comprehensive testing suite covering MCP protocol compliance, integration with SuPy, and end-to-end workflow validation. Ensure robust testing across all MCP functionality and SUEWS model operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for MCP protocol compliance implemented
- [ ] Integration tests with SuPy functionality complete
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests covering key use cases
- [ ] Performance testing for model operations
- [ ] Error handling and edge case testing complete

## Technical Details
Create multi-layered testing approach:

**Unit Tests:**
- MCP server protocol compliance
- Individual tool functionality
- Error handling mechanisms
- Validation rule testing

**Integration Tests:**
- SuPy model integration
- Data processing workflows
- Configuration handling
- File I/O operations

**End-to-End Tests:**
- Complete SUEWS workflow execution
- Multi-step model setup and run scenarios
- Output analysis and validation workflows
- Error recovery and user guidance flows

**Performance Tests:**
- Model execution timing
- Large dataset handling
- Concurrent operation testing
- Resource usage monitoring

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Core Tools must be implemented
- [ ] Task 003: SUEWS Integration must be complete
- [ ] Task 005: Error Handling & Intelligence must be ready

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete test suite implemented
- [ ] All tests passing in CI environment
- [ ] Test coverage meets quality standards
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Testing documentation complete
