0,"Uses values provided in the meteorological forcing file (SSss_YYYY_data_tt.txt) to calculate QF.
If you do not want to include QF to the calculation of surface energy balance, you should set values in the meteorological forcing file to zero to prevent calculation of QF.
UMEP provides two methods to calculate QF
LQF which is simpler
GQF which is more complete but requires more data inputs"
1,"|NotRecmd|
QF calculated according to :cite:t:`L11` using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt`.
Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file. CO2 emission is not calculated."
2,"|Recmd|
QF calculated according to :cite:t:`J11` using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt` and diurnal patterns specified in `SUEWS_Profiles.txt`.
Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file. CO2 emission is not calculated."
3,"Updated :cite:t:`L11` method using daily (not instantaneous) air temperature (HDD(id-1,3)) using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt`. CO2 emission is not calculated."
4,":cite:t:`J19` method, in addition to anthropogenic heat due to building energy use calculated by :cite:t:`J11`, that due to metabolism and traffic is also calculated using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt` and diurnal patterns specified in `SUEWS_Profiles.txt`.
Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file. CO2 emission is not calculated."
45,"QF calculated using EmissionMethod = 4. Fc (both biogenic and anthropogenic) components calculated following :cite:t:`J19`. 
Emissions from traffic and human metabolism calculated as a bottom up approach using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt`
and diurnal patterns specified in `SUEWS_Profiles.txt`. Building emissions are calculated with the aid of heating and cooling degree days. 
Biogenic emissions and sinks are calculated using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_BiogenCO2.txt`."
