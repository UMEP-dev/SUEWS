Future Integration Features
===========================

**Planned Enhancements:**

- **YAML-based coupling configurations**: Standardised coupling parameter specification
- **Validated coupling interfaces**: Pre-tested integration patterns for common external models
- **Enhanced error handling**: Robust error management for coupled simulations
- **Performance optimisation**: Efficient data exchange for large-scale coupled models

Development Roadmap
-------------------

**Short-term (Next 6-12 months):**
- Fix external-interaction notebook API compatibility issues
- Improve WRF-SUEWS integration with modern SuPy workflows
- Develop standardised coupling interfaces for common model types

**Medium-term (1-2 years):**
- YAML-based coupling configuration system
- Automated parameter generation tools
- Enhanced UMEP-SuPy integration

**Long-term (2+ years):**
- Real-time model coupling capabilities
- Cloud-based integration workflows
- Machine learning-enhanced parameter estimation
