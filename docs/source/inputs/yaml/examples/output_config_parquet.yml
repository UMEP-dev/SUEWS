# Example: Parquet output configuration
# This example shows how to use the modern Parquet format for more efficient storage

model:
  control:
    tstep: 300  # 5-minute timestep
    forcing_file: "forcing_2020.txt"
    
    # Parquet output configuration
    # Parquet files are more efficient for storage and faster to read
    output_file:
      format: parquet   # Modern columnar format
      freq: 300         # Keep original 5-minute resolution (no resampling)
      # Note: For Parquet format, all groups are saved in a single file
      # The 'groups' parameter is ignored for Parquet output

    longitude: -0.1

# Benefits of Parquet format:
# - Single file output (instead of multiple text files per year/group)
# - Typically 70-80% smaller file size (2-5x compression vs text)
# - Much faster to read into pandas/Python
# - Preserves data types (no parsing needed)
# - Works well with cloud storage and big data tools

# Output files created:
# - {site}_SUEWS_output.parquet - All output data (all years, all groups)
# - {site}_SUEWS_state_final.parquet - Final model state for restart runs
