  category: storage_heat
  purpose: >-
    Controls whether anthropogenic heat flux (QF) is included in the OHM
    storage heat calculation, switching between Q* only and Q*+QF as input.

    OHM calculates storage heat flux from net all-wave radiation and its time
    derivative. This toggle controls whether the input radiation term is Q*
    alone (method 0) or Q*+QF (method 1), where QF is the anthropogenic heat
    flux. Including QF accounts for anthropogenic energy input to the surface
    energy balance before computing storage heat flux.

user_guidance:
  configuration_notes: >-
    OhmIncQf=0 uses Q* only (required when StorageHeatMethod=1).
    OhmIncQf=1 uses Q*+QF (for other OHM-based storage heat methods).
  common_pitfalls:
    - "OhmIncQf must be 0 when StorageHeatMethod=1; incorrect pairing causes errors"
