    Diagnoses vertical profiles of wind speed, temperature and humidity within
    and above the urban roughness sublayer for near-surface meteorological variables.

    The RSL scheme calculates diagnostic profiles at 30 uneven levels between
    the ground and forcing height. Two approaches are available: standard
    Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) for relatively homogeneous surfaces,
    and the Harman and Finnigan roughness sublayer theory that accounts for the
    departure from MOST within and just above the urban canopy. The RSL approach
    uses momentum and scalar roughness sublayer correction functions (psi-hat)
    that depend on canopy morphology (mean height, displacement height, frontal
    area index) and atmospheric stability. Canopy layers are distributed
    adaptively: 3 layers for mean element heights below 2 m, 10 for heights up
    to 10 m, and 15 for taller canopies.

  key_assumptions:
    - "Forcing data are provided above the blending height"
    - "Profiles are diagnosed downward from the forcing level into the canopy"
    - "Buildings are assumed to be of uniform height within a grid cell"
    - "Horizontal homogeneity within the neighbourhood scale"
  comparison_to_established: >-
    MOST (option 0) is the classical surface-layer approach valid well above
    the roughness sublayer. The RST option (1) extends this with roughness
    sublayer corrections following Harman and Finnigan, improving accuracy
    for heterogeneous urban surfaces where MOST assumptions break down. The
    VARIABLE option (2) automatically selects between the two based on surface
    morphology.

  performance_summary: >-
    Validated against observed urban temperature and wind profiles. The RSL
    correction significantly improves near-surface diagnostics (T2, U10)
    compared to MOST alone in dense urban environments. Performance is best
    when morphological parameters are accurately characterised.

  not_recommended_for:
    - "Flat homogeneous terrain where standard MOST is sufficient (use option 0)"
    - "Street canyon or microscale applications below the neighbourhood scale"
  configuration_notes: >-
    RSLMethod=0 uses standard MOST, suitable for relatively open or homogeneous
    sites. RSLMethod=1 applies full RSL corrections and is recommended for urban
    areas with significant roughness elements. RSLMethod=2 automatically selects
    between the two based on morphological criteria. A related setting, RSLLevel,
    controls local environmental feedbacks: 0 (NONE) disables adjustments, 1
    (BASIC) provides simple urban temperature effects on LAI and growing degree
    days, and 2 (DETAILED) includes comprehensive feedbacks such as moisture
    stress and urban CO2 dome effects.
  common_pitfalls:
    - "Forcing data must be above the blending height; low forcing heights invalidate the diagnostic approach"
    - "Inaccurate morphological parameters (Zh, FAI) propagate directly into RSL correction errors"
    - "RSL profiles assume uniform building height; high variability within a grid cell reduces accuracy"
