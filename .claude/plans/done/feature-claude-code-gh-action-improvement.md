# Feature: GitHub Actions Workflow Improvements

## Context
Comprehensive enhancement of the SUEWS repository's GitHub Actions workflows to improve performance, security, maintainability, and cost efficiency. The existing workflows needed modernisation, better error handling, and performance optimisations.

## GitHub Issues
- General workflow improvements and modernisation
- Performance optimisation needs
- Security enhancements required
- Cost efficiency improvements for Claude workflows

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Analyse existing GitHub Actions workflows
- [x] Identify improvement opportunities
- [x] Add concurrency control to all workflows
- [x] Modernise GitHub Actions versions and dependencies
- [x] Enhance build workflow performance and security
- [x] Improve Claude workflows with better error handling
- [x] Optimise Fortran prettify workflow
- [x] Create comprehensive CI workflow
- [x] Update documentation with new features
- [x] Validate all workflow syntax and functionality

## Key Decisions
- **Model Switch**: Changed from Claude Opus 4 to Sonnet 4 for better cost/performance balance
- **Concurrency Control**: Added to all workflows to prevent conflicts and resource waste
- **Smart Detection**: Implemented conditional execution to avoid unnecessary work
- **Security Enhancement**: Added proper permissions and validation steps
- **Caching Strategy**: Comprehensive caching for Python dependencies and build artifacts

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Optimisations
- **Concurrency Control**: Prevents multiple builds/runs on same branch/PR
- **Enhanced Caching**: Added caching for pip, ruff, and other dependencies
- **Smart Detection**: Workflows only run when necessary (format checks, file changes)
- **Updated Actions**: Modernised all action versions for better performance

### Security Enhancements
- **Proper Permissions**: Explicit permission declarations for all workflows
- **Wheel Validation**: Added twine check before PyPI publishing
- **Enhanced User Feedback**: Better error messages for unauthorised Claude access
- **ID Token**: Enabled trusted publishing for PyPI

### Claude Workflow Improvements
- **Cost Efficiency**: Switched to Sonnet 4 for better cost/performance ratio
- **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced feedback with formatted messages
- **Concurrency Protection**: Prevents overlapping Claude executions per issue/PR

### New Features
- **Comprehensive CI**: New workflow for code quality checks and branch protection
- **Job Summaries**: Detailed output formatting for better visibility
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated README with all new features and best practices

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/build-publish_to_pypi.yml` - Enhanced build workflow
- `.github/workflows/claude.yml` - Improved Claude automation
- `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` - Enhanced code review workflow
- `.github/workflows/fprettify.yml` - Optimised Fortran formatting
- `.github/workflows/ruff-format.yml.disabled` - Enhanced Python formatting (disabled)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - New comprehensive CI workflow (created)
- `.github/workflows/README.md` - Updated documentation

## Testing Strategy
- Validated YAML syntax for all workflows
- Tested workflow logic and conditional execution
- Verified caching strategies and performance improvements
- Confirmed security enhancements and permissions

## Current Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - All improvements implemented and committed to feature branch

### Summary of Improvements
1. **Build Workflow**: Added concurrency control, caching, security enhancements, and wheel validation
2. **Claude Workflows**: Switched to Sonnet 4, improved error handling, added concurrency protection
3. **Fortran Prettify**: Added smart detection, caching, and better commit messages
4. **New CI Pipeline**: Comprehensive code quality checks and branch protection
5. **Documentation**: Updated with all new features, best practices, and troubleshooting

### Ready for Review
All changes are committed locally and ready for review before pushing to remote repository. The improvements maintain backward compatibility while significantly enhancing performance, security, and maintainability.
