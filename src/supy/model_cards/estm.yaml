  category: storage_heat
  purpose: >-
    Calculates storage heat flux and surface temperatures using 1D heat
    conduction through urban surface elements.

scientific_basis:
  theoretical_basis: >-
    ESTM solves the one-dimensional heat conduction equation through urban
    surface elements (roof, wall, ground) to compute storage heat flux and
    surface temperatures. The method was described in Offerle et al. (2005).

    - "Any new applications"
  configuration_notes: >-
    StorageHeatMethod=4 selects ESTM. This method is deprecated and not
    recommended. Use EHC (StorageHeatMethod=5) for explicit heat conduction
    or STEBBS (StorageHeatMethod=7) for full building energy modelling.

governance:
  candidate_for_deprecation: true
  deprecation_rationale: >-
    Superseded by EHC (StorageHeatMethod=5) which provides multi-level
    building support, adaptive numerical methods, and improved solver
    stability. STEBBS (StorageHeatMethod=7) extends further with full
    building energy modelling.
  migration_path: >-
    Migrate to EHC (StorageHeatMethod=5) for physically equivalent heat
    conduction with improved numerics, or STEBBS (StorageHeatMethod=7) for
    full building energy modelling including indoor processes.
