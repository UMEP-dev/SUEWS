## Test Scenario Summary

**Objective**: Validate complete MCP workflow with realistic, challenging scenario

**Scenario Details**:
- **Location**: Phoenix, Arizona (33.45°N, 112.07°W, 331m elevation)
- **Time**: July (1 week for fast test, extendable to full month)
- **Climate**: Hot desert (40-45°C daily max)
- **Treatment**: 30% irrigation reduction

**Why This Scenario?**:
1. **Realistic**: Urban water management is actual SUEWS use case
2. **Challenging**: Hot, arid conditions stress-test model
3. **Complete workflow**: Tests all 5 MCP tools in sequence
4. **Measurable**: Clear expected outcomes (temperature, energy fluxes)

---

## MCP Tools Tested

Full end-to-end workflow:

1. **create_config** - Create baseline and treatment configs from template
2. **update_config** - Apply nested parameter updates (model.control.tstep, etc.)
3. **validate_config** - Check configs valid before simulation
4. **run_simulation** - Execute SUEWS for both scenarios
5. **load_results** - Load and analyse output data

---

## Expected Test Flow

### Quick Test (5 minutes)
```
Start → create_config → update_config (nested) → validate → Pass/Fail
```

**Purpose**: Verify config tools work without waiting for simulations

**Expected outcome**: ✅ Pass (configs created, nested updates applied)

### Full Test (20-30 minutes)
```
Start → create_config (x2) → update_config → validate →
run_simulation (baseline) → run_simulation (treatment) →
load_results (x2) → compare → energy balance check → Pass/Fail
```

**Purpose**: Validate complete workflow including simulations

**Expected outcome**: ✅ Pass (both sims complete, energy balance good)

---

## Success Criteria

### Quick Test Must Have
- ✅ No Python errors
- ✅ Config files created in tmp directory
- ✅ Nested updates applied (model.control.tstep = 3600)
- ✅ Configs loadable as YAML

### Full Test Must Have
- ✅ Both simulations complete without errors
- ✅ Output files generated (.pkl or .txt)
- ✅ Data loadable via load_results
- ✅ Required variables present (QH, QE, QS, QN)
- ✅ Energy balance closure 80-120%

### Nice to Have
- ✨ Treatment shows different results (if irrigation modified)
- ✨ Results match Phoenix climate expectations
- ✨ Execution time reasonable (<5 min for full test)

---

## Known Limitations

### Irrigation Parameters
**Current state**: Irrigation parameters may not be fully accessible in config schema

**Impact**:
- Configs can be created and marked differently
- Simulations will run
- But actual irrigation amounts may not differ between baseline/treatment

**Test behavior**:
- Test will note this limitation with warning message
- Test will still PASS (we're validating workflow, not irrigation science)
- Message: "⚠️ Note: Irrigation params not modified (schema limitation)"

**Future**: Once irrigation parameters are in schema, we can modify them via nested update

---

## What cc-test Should Do

### Step 1: Run Quick Test
```bash
cd ~/suews-mcp-testing
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest test_phoenix_irrigation.py::test_phoenix_config_creation_only -v -s
```

**Expected time**: 5 minutes
**Expected result**: PASSED

### Step 2: If Quick Passes, Run Full Test
```bash
python -m pytest test_phoenix_irrigation.py::test_phoenix_irrigation_reduction_workflow -v -s
```

**Expected time**: 20-30 minutes
**Expected result**: PASSED (with possible irrigation warning)

### Step 3: Report Results
Update `shared-comms/TESTING_STATUS.md` using provided template

**Include**:
- Pass/fail status
- Duration
- Energy balance closures
- Key metrics (QH, QE, etc.)
- Any errors or warnings
- Observations

---

## Contingency Scenarios

### Scenario A: Quick Test Fails
**Most likely cause**: Path issues or missing sample config

**Action**:
1. Check error message
2. Report in BUG_REPORTS.md with full error
3. cc-dev will investigate
4. Do NOT proceed to full test

### Scenario B: Full Test Fails at Simulation
**Possible causes**:
- Missing forcing data
- SUEWSSimulation initialization issue
- SuPy not properly installed

**Action**:
1. Note which simulation failed (baseline or treatment)
2. Check if error is MCP tool bug or SUEWS/SuPy issue
3. Report with full error message
4. cc-dev will investigate

### Scenario C: Results Look Wrong
**Possible issues**:
- Energy balance closure <80% or >120%
- Negative fluxes (should be mostly positive)
- Extreme temperatures (<-20°C or >60°C)

**Action**:
1. Report results anyway (partial pass)
2. Note specific concerns
3. cc-dev will review if expected or bug
