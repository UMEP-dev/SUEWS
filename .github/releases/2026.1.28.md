## What's New

Version 2026.1.28 (released on 28 January 2026)

This release focuses on stability improvements for QGIS/UMEP users, physics corrections, and executable documentation.

### Notable Changes

**QGIS Crash Fix**

- Resolved crash issue where SUEWS caused QGIS to fail mid-run
- Removed stdout writes (`PRINT *`, `WRITE(*,*)`) that conflicted with QGIS output handling
- Replaced problematic code with structured warnings
- Improved thread safety for parallel simulations
- Related PRs: #1086, #1083

**QGIS/UMEP Test Suite**

- Added comprehensive compatibility tests to catch QGIS integration issues before release (#905)

**Executable Documentation**

- Tutorial examples now run during documentation builds via sphinx-gallery
- Ensures code examples remain current (#1057)

### Physics Fixes

- **Biogenic CO2**: Fixed FcRespi calculation to use local climate instead of global average temperature (#1117)

- **NumCapita Initialisation**: Fixed uninitialised NumCapita causing NaN values in CO2 flux calculations (#1053)

- **Error Flag Management**: Reset error flag before kernel calls to prevent stale errors across runs (#1109)

### Other Improvements

- Pandas 3.0 forward compatibility (#1106)
- Improved validation ranges for albedo and emissivity (#978, #979)
- Structured error handling with detailed validation reports (#1070)
- Vendored f90wrap runtime to eliminate pip dependency conflicts (#963)
