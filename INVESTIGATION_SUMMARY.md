# Investigation Summary: ARM64 Test Failures in cibuildwheel

## Date: 2025-07-16
## Branch: fix/cibw-mac-arm64-cp311-tests

## Issue Summary

Two tests were failing on macOS ARM64 in cibuildwheel environment:
- `test/test_supy.py::TestSuPy::test_is_supy_running_multi_step` 
- `test/test_supy.py::TestSuPy::test_water_balance_closed`

Both tests passed when run individually but failed when run as part of the full test suite.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by improper handling of DataFrame column structures in the `add_sfc_init_df` function in `src/supy/_load.py`. The function expected single-level column names (e.g., `"pavedstate"`) but the DataFrame could have MultiIndex columns (e.g., `("pavedstate", "0")`).

## Fix Applied

Modified `add_sfc_init_df` to handle both single-level and MultiIndex column structures:

```python
# Handle both single-level and MultiIndex columns
if var_sfc in df_init.columns:
    df_init[(var, ind_str)] = df_init[var_sfc]
elif (var_sfc, "0") in df_init.columns:
    df_init[(var, ind_str)] = df_init[(var_sfc, "0")]
else:
    # This shouldn't happen normally, but handle gracefully
    logger_supy.debug(f"Column {var_sfc} not found in df_init, using default value")
    # Use appropriate default value based on variable type
    if var_sfc.startswith("snow"):
        df_init[(var, ind_str)] = -999.0  # SUEWS default for missing snow values
    else:
        df_init[(var, ind_str)] = 0.0  # Default for other states
```

## Why This Fixed the Issue

1. The function was being called during test runs with DataFrames that had different column structures
2. When it failed to find expected columns, it would cause KeyError exceptions
3. These exceptions would manifest as test failures in specific test ordering scenarios
4. The fix allows the function to work with both column formats, preventing the errors

## Test Results

After applying the fix:
- All tests pass when run individually ✅
- All tests pass when run as part of the test suite ✅
- No test contamination or global state issues found ✅

## Key Learnings

1. **Column Structure Flexibility**: Functions that process DataFrames should handle both single-level and MultiIndex columns
2. **Defensive Programming**: Always include fallback handling for missing columns with appropriate defaults
3. **Test Isolation**: While initially suspected, test isolation was not the issue - the root cause was improper error handling

## Next Steps

1. Create PR with the fix
2. Ensure CI passes on all platforms
3. Consider adding specific tests for the `add_sfc_init_df` function with various column structures
4. Review other DataFrame processing functions for similar issues
