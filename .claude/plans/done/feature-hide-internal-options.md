## Lead Developer
- **GitHub**: @sunt05
- **Started**: 2025-06-29

## Context
This feature addressed the need to hide internal/advanced options from the standard user interface to reduce confusion and improve usability. Internal options should only be visible to advanced users or developers.

## GitHub Issues
- #439 - Hide internal options from standard interface (PRIMARY)

## Status
- **Current**: done
- **Outcome**: completed
- **Completed**: 2025-06-29
- **PR**: #439

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Implementation
- [x] Identified all internal options in the configuration
- [x] Implemented visibility flags for internal options
- [x] Updated documentation to reflect changes
- [x] Added advanced mode toggle for showing internal options
- [x] Updated tests to handle both standard and advanced modes

## Key Decisions
- **UI Strategy**: Use visibility flags rather than removing options entirely
- **Toggle Design**: Implement advanced mode toggle for power users
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain full functionality while improving default UX
