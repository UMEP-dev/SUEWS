- **Improvement**

  #. An anthropogenic emission module is added. Module details refer to JÃ¤rvi et al. (2019) :cite:`J19`.

  #. A `canyon profile module <rsl_mod>`_ is added. Module details refer to Theeuwes et al. (2019) :cite:`T19`.



- **Changes**

  #. Input file ``SUEWS_AnthropogenicHeat.txt`` is renamed to ``SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt`` with new parameters added: `MinFCMetab`, `MaxFCMetab`, `FrPDDwe`, `FcEF_v_kgkmWD` and `FcEF_v_kgkmWE`.
  #. BLUEWS has been recovered; set `CBLUse` to use it.
  #. Removed features:

    - SOLWEIG: fully removed from code.
    - netCDF: fully removed as this is very infrequently used;
      users who need this are suggested to use ``SuPy`` with help from ``pandas`` and `xarray <https://xarray.pydata.org>`_ to save results in netCDF more elegantly.


- **Fix**

  #. Fixed a bug in LAI calculation for longterm runs.
  #. Fixed a bug in net all-wave radiation differential calculation for OHM.
  #. Fixed a bug in GDD/SDD calculation that different vegetative land covers could unexpectedly affect each other.
  #. Fixed water redistribution bug in snow module.

- **Known issues**

  #. Wind direction is not currently downscaled so non -999 values will cause an error.
