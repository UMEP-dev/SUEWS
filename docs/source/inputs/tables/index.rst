Table-based Input Files (Legacy Format)
========================================

.. warning::

   **DEPRECATED FORMAT**: Table-based input files are deprecated as of 2025 and will be removed by end of 2025.

   **For new users**: Please use the modern :ref:`YAML format <yaml_input>` instead.

   **For existing users**: Please migrate to the YAML format using:

   - 🌐 **Interactive builder**: `SUEWS Configuration Builder <../../_static/index.html>`__ (recommended for beginners)
   - 📖 **Migration guide**: :doc:`Transition Guide <../transition_guide>`
