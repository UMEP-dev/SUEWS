 abstract = {While approximately 338 million people in the Northern hemisphere live in regions that are regularly snow covered in winter, there is little hydro-climatologic knowledge in the cities impacted by snow. Using observations and modelling we have evaluated the energy and water exchanges of four cities that are exposed to wintertime snow. We show that the presence of snow critically changes the impact that city design has on the local-scale hydrology and climate. After snow melt, the cities return to being strongly controlled by the proportion of built and vegetated surfaces. However in winter, the presence of snow masks the influence of the built and vegetated fractions. We show how inter-year variability of wintertime temperature can modify this effect of snow. With increasing temperatures, these cities could be pushed towards very different partitioning between runoff and evapotranspiration. We derive the dependency of wintertime runoff on this warming effect in combination with the effect of urban densification.},

 abstract = {Often the meteorological forcing data required for urban hydrological models are unavailable at the required temporal resolution or for the desired period. Although reanalysis data can provide this information, the spatial resolution is often coarse relative to cities, so downscaling is required prior to use as realistic forcing. In this study, WATCH WFDEI reanalysis data are used to force the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS). From sensitivity tests in two cities, Vancouver and London with different orography, we conclude precipitation is the most important meteorological variable to be properly downscaled to obtain reliable surface hydrology results, with relative humidity being the second most important. Overestimation of precipitation in reanalysis data at the three sites gives 6--21},

 abstract = {Climate-sensitive urban design is an increasingly important consideration for city planners and policy makers. This study demonstrates the use of a biophysical model to assess the response of urban climate to various changes, including population growth, reduced energy use, urban development and urban greening initiatives. Model inputs are intentionally derived using only publicly available information and assumptions involved in collating the data are discussed. Results are summarised in terms of the energy partitioning which captures changes in meteorology, surface characteristics and human behaviour. The model has been recently evaluated for the region, and those findings are drawn upon here to discuss the model's capabilities and limitations. Model simulations demonstrate how both intentional and inadvertent changes to the urban landscape can alter the urban climate. For example, the impact of population growth depends on where, and how, people are housed, and recent changes in garden composition have reduced evaporation. This study has been designed so that model output could be combined with socio-economic data in future, enabling both risk and vulnerability to be considered together.},

Here, a new urban surface carbon dioxide (CO2) flux module for the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme is described and evaluated using eddy covariance observations at two sites in Helsinki in 2012. The spatial variability and magnitude of local-scale anthropogenic and biogenic CO2 flux components at high spatial (250 m $\times$ 250 m) and temporal (hourly) resolution are examined by combining high-resolution (down to 2 m) airborne lidar-derived land use data and mobility data to account for people's movement. Urban effects are included in the biogenic components parameterized using urban eddy covariance and chamber observations. Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme reproduces the seasonal and diurnal variability of the CO2 flux well. Annual totals deviate 3},

 abstract = {AbstractThe Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) is used to investigate the impact of anthropogenic heat flux QF and irrigation on surface energy balance partitioning in a central business district of Shanghai. Diurnal profiles of QF are carefully derived based on city-specific hourly electricity consumption data, hourly traffic data, and dynamic population density. The QF is estimated to be largest in summer (mean daily peak 236 W m$-$2). When QF is omitted, the SUEWS sensible heat flux QH reproduces the observed diurnal pattern generally well, but the magnitude is underestimated compared to observations for all seasons. When QF is included, the QH estimates are improved in spring, summer, and autumn but are poorer in winter, indicating winter QF is overestimated. Inclusion of QF has little influence on the simulated latent heat flux QE but improves the storage heat flux estimates except in winter. Irrigation, both amount and frequency, has a large impact on QE. When irrigation is not considered, the simulated QE is underestimated for all seasons. The mean summer daytime QE is largely overestimated compared to observations under continuous irrigation conditions. Model results are improved when irrigation occurs with a 3-day frequency, especially in summer. Results are consistent with observed monthly outdoor water use. This study highlights the importance of appropriately including QF and irrigation in urban land surface models---terms not generally considered in many previous studies.},

abstract = {{Despite building energy use being one of the largest global energy consumers, building energy simulations rarely take the actual local neighbourhood scale climate into account. A new globally applicable approach is proposed to support buildings energy design. ERA5 (European Centre Reanalysis version 5) data are used with SUEWS (Surface Urban Energy and Water balance Scheme) to obtain (in this example case) an urban typical meteorological year (uTMY) that is usable in building energy modelling. The predicted annual energy demand (heating and cooling) for a representative four-storey London residential apartment using uTMY is 6.9\% less (cf. conventional TMY). New vertical profile coefficients for wind speed and air temperature in EnergyPlus are derived using SUEWS. EneryPlus simulations with these neighbourhood scale coefficients and uTMY data, predict the top two floors have \textbackslashtextasciitilde10\% larger energy demand (cf. the open terrain coefficients with uTMY data). Vertical variations in wind speed have a greater impact on the simulated building energy than equivalent variations in temperature. This globally appliable approach can provide local meteorological data for building energy modelling, improving design for the local context through characterising the surrounding neighbourhood.}},
