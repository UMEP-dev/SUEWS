    transfer in the surface layer under non-neutral atmospheric conditions.

    Atmospheric stability corrections modify the logarithmic wind and
    temperature profiles to account for buoyancy effects. The corrections are
    expressed as integrated stability functions psi(z/L) for profile
    calculations and dimensionless gradients phi(z/L) for flux-gradient
    relationships, where L is the Obukhov length. Three formulations are
    available: method 2 uses Dyer (1974) modified by Hogstrom (1988) for the
    unstable case with Van Ulden and Holtslag (1985) for stable conditions;
    method 3 follows Kondo (1975) as adopted by Campbell and Norman (1998);
    method 4 uses Businger et al. (1971) modified by Hogstrom (1988). A
    neutral stability limit parameter prevents division by zero when
    conditions are very close to neutral (|z/L| < 1e-4).

  key_assumptions:
    - "Monin-Obukhov similarity applies within the surface layer"
    - "The Obukhov length L adequately characterises atmospheric stability"
    - "Stability functions are universal (site-independent) for a given formulation"
    - "Near-neutral conditions are handled by a neutral-limit threshold"
  comparison_to_established: >-
    All three methods are well-established semi-empirical formulations from the
    micrometeorological literature. The Campbell and Norman (method 3)
    formulation, based on Kondo (1975), provides consistent behaviour across
    the full stability range and is the recommended default. Methods 2 and 4
    are retained for backward compatibility but are not recommended for
    general use.

    - "Multiple surface-layer observation campaigns"
  performance_summary: >-
    The stability functions are well-tested empirical formulations validated
    against decades of surface-layer observations. Method 3 (Campbell and
    Norman) provides robust behaviour across a wide range of stability
    conditions and is recommended as the default.

  configuration_notes: >-
    StabilityMethod=3 (Campbell and Norman 1998, based on Kondo 1975) is the
    recommended default and provides robust behaviour across all stability
    regimes. Method 2 (Dyer/Hogstrom with Van Ulden and Holtslag stable
    correction) and method 4 (Businger/Hogstrom) are available for backward
    compatibility or specialist comparisons but are not recommended for
    production runs. Values 0 and 1 are reserved (NOT_USED) and should not
    be selected.
  common_pitfalls:
    - "Using method 2 or 4 without understanding their limitations in strongly stable/unstable conditions"
    - "Stability corrections become unreliable when z/L is extremely large; the model applies internal limits"
    - "The choice of stability method affects aerodynamic resistance and thus all turbulent fluxes"
