  scheme_name: water_use
  full_name: External Water Use Method
  category: water_balance
  purpose: >-
    Controls whether external water use (irrigation) is modelled internally
    or read from observations.
  version_introduced: "v1.0"
  original_authors:

  enum_class: WaterUseMethod
  enum_values: [0, 1]

scientific_basis:
  theoretical_basis: >-
    External water use adds water to the surface water balance independently
    of precipitation, affecting soil moisture and evapotranspiration. Method 0
    models irrigation based on soil moisture deficit, day of week, and
    temperature-dependent demand parameters. Method 1 reads observed water
    use directly from the forcing file.

    - "Irrigation is distributed across irrigable surface types"
    - "Modelled irrigation responds to soil moisture deficit"

evaluation_evidence:
  evaluation_status: peer-reviewed
  performance_summary: >-
    Validated as part of the full SUEWS water balance at sites with
    significant irrigation (e.g., suburban areas in warm climates).

  configuration_notes: >-
    WaterUseMethod=0 models irrigation internally based on soil moisture
    deficit and irrigation parameters. WaterUseMethod=1 reads observed
    water use values from the forcing file.
