# Task: Data Preprocessing Tools

## Description
Implement data preprocessing and validation tools for SUEWS simulations. These tools handle meteorological forcing data preparation, configuration validation, and data format conversion utilities that support the core simulation workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] preprocess_forcing tool for meteorological data handling
- [ ] validate_config tool for comprehensive configuration checking
- [ ] Data format conversion utilities (CSV, NetCDF, etc.)
- [ ] Input data quality checks and validation
- [ ] Support for common meteorological data formats
- [ ] Clear error reporting for data issues

## Technical Details
- Implement forcing data preprocessing with unit conversion
- Add configuration validation against SUEWS requirements
- Create data format detection and conversion utilities
- Implement quality checks for meteorological inputs
- Add support for time series data validation
- Handle missing data detection and reporting
- Support standard meteorological file formats

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: MCP Server Setup completed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
