# Task #642: Packaging & Documentation - Parallel Work Analysis

## Overview
Finalize the SUEWS MCP server for distribution by setting up proper Python packaging, creating comprehensive documentation, and ensuring PyPI readiness.

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Package Configuration & Build (package-setup)
**Files to create/modify:**
- `suews-mcp/setup.py` (for compatibility)
- `suews-mcp/pyproject.toml` (enhance existing)
- `suews-mcp/MANIFEST.in`
- `suews-mcp/requirements-dev.txt`
- `suews-mcp/tox.ini`

**Work:**
1. Enhance pyproject.toml with complete metadata and classifiers
2. Create setup.py for backward compatibility
3. Configure MANIFEST.in for non-Python files
4. Set up development requirements
5. Configure tox for multi-environment testing

**Agent type:** general-purpose

### Stream B: Documentation & Examples (docs-examples)
**Files to create/modify:**
- `suews-mcp/README.md` (enhance existing)
- `suews-mcp/docs/quickstart.md`
- `suews-mcp/docs/api_reference.md`
- `suews-mcp/docs/examples/`
- `suews-mcp/examples/notebooks/`

**Work:**
1. Enhance README with comprehensive installation and usage
2. Create quickstart guide with step-by-step tutorial
3. Document all MCP tools with parameters and examples
4. Create example notebooks for common workflows
5. Add troubleshooting and FAQ sections

**Agent type:** general-purpose

### Stream C: Distribution & CI Setup (distribution)
**Files to create/modify:**
- `suews-mcp/.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- `suews-mcp/.github/workflows/test.yml`
- `suews-mcp/Makefile`
- `suews-mcp/CHANGELOG.md`
- `suews-mcp/LICENSE`

**Work:**
1. Set up GitHub Actions for testing and publishing
2. Create Makefile for common development tasks
3. Initialize CHANGELOG with version history
4. Add appropriate license file
5. Configure PyPI publishing workflow

**Agent type:** general-purpose

## Execution Strategy
All three streams can work in parallel as they focus on different aspects:
- Stream A handles Python packaging infrastructure
- Stream B creates user-facing documentation
- Stream C sets up distribution and CI/CD

## Coordination Points
- All streams should reference the same version number (0.1.0)
- Documentation should match the actual implemented tools
- CI configuration should run the tests created in Task #641

## Success Metrics
- Package installable via `pip install -e .` and `pip install suews-mcp`
- Documentation covers all 10+ MCP tools
- CI pipeline runs all test suites
- Package ready for PyPI upload
