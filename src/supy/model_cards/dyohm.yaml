  purpose: >-
    Extends OHM by dynamically calculating the hysteresis coefficients
    (a1, a2, a3) from material thermal properties and meteorological
    conditions, removing the need for empirically pre-calibrated values.

    DyOHM retains the OHM formulation (delta QS = a1*Q* + a2*(dQ*/dt) + a3)
    but replaces the fixed empirical coefficients with values calculated
    dynamically at each day from material properties and meteorological
    state. The coefficients are derived from thermal admittance
    (sqrt(C*k)), thermal diffusivity (k/C), building wall thickness,
    the complete surface area to plan area ratio (lambda_c), daily mean
    net all-wave radiation, wind speed, and day-to-day air temperature
    change. Coefficient a1 captures the amplitude response through a
    damped oscillation in wall thickness scaled by thermal admittance;
    a2 captures the phase lag via thermal diffusivity and wind-radiation
    interactions; a3 accounts for the residual offset driven by
    inter-day temperature change. Surface temperature profiles are
    subsequently diagnosed using an explicit finite-difference scheme
    driven by the computed storage heat flux.

    - "OHM functional form (linear in Q* and dQ*/dt) remains valid"
    - "Coefficients can be parameterised from bulk material properties and daily meteorology"

  comparison_to_established: >-
    DyOHM bridges the gap between the simplicity of OHM and the
    computational cost of explicit heat conduction schemes (EHC, STEBBS).
    It retains OHM's low computational overhead while eliminating the
    need for site-specific empirical coefficient calibration. Unlike EHC,
    DyOHM does not resolve multi-layer temperature profiles within the
    conduction solver itself but uses the computed storage heat flux to
    diagnose surface temperatures via a post-processing step.

evaluation_evidence:
  evaluation_status: preprint
  performance_summary: >-
    Under evaluation as part of Liu et al. (in preparation). Initial
    testing shows improved storage heat flux estimates for building
    surfaces compared to fixed OHM coefficients, particularly for sites
    where calibrated coefficients are unavailable. Formal peer-reviewed
    validation is pending publication.

  configuration_notes: >-
    StorageHeatMethod=6 enables DyOHM for all surface types. Wall layer
    thermal properties (thickness, conductivity, heat capacity) and the
    complete surface area to plan area ratio (lambda_c) must be specified.
    Coefficients are recalculated daily at midnight using running averages
    of wind speed and net radiation accumulated over the preceding day.
    For non-building surfaces, lambda_c is set to 1 and wind speed to zero
    as a simplification.
  common_pitfalls:
    - "Material thermal properties must be physically reasonable (positive values required)"
    - "Very low wind speeds are clamped to 0.1 m/s to avoid numerical issues"
    - "Coefficients are only updated once per day; sub-daily material property changes are not captured"
