# Sample SUEWS initial conditions data
# This file shows example initial state values for different surface types
# Values should be adjusted based on your local climate and season
#
# Format: Space-separated values
# Units: See SUEWS documentation
#
# These values represent typical winter conditions in a temperate climate
# For your site, adjust based on:
# - Local climate conditions
# - Season of simulation start
# - Surface characteristics
# - Previous weather conditions
#
# Surface types: Paved, Bldgs, EveTr, DecTr, Grass, BSoil, Water
# State variables: Soil moisture, temperatures, LAI, etc.
#
# This is a simplified example - actual initial conditions file format
# may differ based on SUEWS version and configuration options

# Example initial soil moisture states (fraction of storage capacity):
# Surface_type Initial_state
Paved 0.3
Bldgs 0.2  
EveTr 0.7
DecTr 0.6
Grass 0.5
BSoil 0.4
Water 1.0

# Example initial surface temperatures (Celsius):
# Surface_type Initial_temp
Paved 2.0
Bldgs 5.0
EveTr 1.0
DecTr 1.0  
Grass 0.5
BSoil 0.0
Water 4.0

# Example initial LAI values:
# Surface_type Initial_LAI
EveTr 4.0
DecTr 1.0
Grass 1.5

# Example initial snow conditions:
# All surfaces start with no snow cover
# Snow_pack Snow_fraction
0.0 0.0

# Note: Actual initial conditions file structure depends on:
# 1. SUEWS version and selected physics options
# 2. Number and type of surface facets
# 3. Thermal layers configuration
# 4. Selected sub-models (ESTM, SPARTACUS, etc.)
#
# For real simulations, use appropriate values for:
# - Your geographic location and climate
# - Season of simulation start date  
# - Local surface characteristics
# - Recent weather history at your site
