    LUMPS (Local-scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme) calculates
    sensible and latent heat fluxes from the available energy (Q* + QF - delta
    QS) using a modified de Bruin and Holtslag approach. The partitioning
    between QH and QE depends on the psychrometric constant, the slope of the
    saturation vapour pressure curve, and an empirical vegetation fraction
    parameter that captures the urban Bowen ratio behaviour. A dynamic water
    bucket tracks surface wetness from rainfall, draining at a specified rate,
    so that wet surfaces evaporate at an enhanced rate. Vegetation phenology
    is derived from LAI to modulate the effective vegetated fraction seasonally
    following Loridan et al. (2011).

  comparison_to_established: >-
    LUMPS is the simpler of two turbulent flux approaches in SUEWS. The full
    SUEWS biophysical approach calculates QE via a Penman-Monteith formulation
    with a detailed surface conductance model (Jarvis type) and derives QH as
    the energy balance residual. LUMPS is always calculated internally and
    provides the initial stability estimate used by the full SUEWS scheme. Both
    sets of fluxes are provided in output files.

  performance_summary: >-
    LUMPS provides reasonable first-order estimates of turbulent fluxes with
    minimal input requirements. It performs best in cities with moderate
    vegetation fractions. For applications requiring accurate latent heat
    fluxes, the full SUEWS biophysical approach is preferred as it accounts
    for surface conductance, soil moisture stress, and irrigation.

    - "Applications where soil moisture stress is an important control on evaporation"
  configuration_notes: >-
    LUMPS is always calculated internally by SUEWS and does not have its own
    selection enum. It provides the initial stability estimate used by the full
    SUEWS energy balance. Both LUMPS and SUEWS turbulent fluxes are written to
    output files. The choice between reporting LUMPS or SUEWS fluxes as the
    primary result depends on the user's analysis. For most applications the
    full SUEWS biophysical QE is preferred.
  common_pitfalls:
    - "LUMPS QE does not account for surface conductance or soil moisture stress"
    - "Rain bucket parameters (drain rate, cover threshold) need site-appropriate values"
    - "Vegetation phenology in LUMPS uses a simplified LAI-based approach that may differ from the full SUEWS phenology"
