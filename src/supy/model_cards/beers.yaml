    BEERS is the successor to SOLWEIG and provides point-specific radiation
    analysis within urban environments. It solves the urban radiation balance
    by computing sun position using astronomical algorithms, analysing 3D
    urban geometry to determine sky view factors and shadow patterns, and
    calculating direct, diffuse, and reflected shortwave and longwave
    radiation components from all cardinal directions. Surface temperatures
    for ground, wall, and roof facets are computed from energy balance
    considerations. Mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is derived by integrating
    directional radiation fluxes weighted by human body shape factors for a
    standing person (Fside=0.22, Fup=0.06) and absorption coefficients for
    shortwave (absK=0.7) and longwave (absL=0.97) radiation.
  key_publications:
    - "F08"
    - "FG11"
  key_assumptions:
    - "Urban geometry is characterised by plan area fraction and frontal area fraction"
    - "Sky view factors are derived from height-to-width ratio"
    - "Human body is represented as a standing person with fixed shape factors"
    - "Direct and diffuse shortwave components are calculated from global radiation (clearness index)"
    - "Shadow patterns on roofs are treated as constant (not geometry-dependent)"
  comparison_to_established: >-
    BEERS provides point-specific radiation analysis and mean radiant
    temperature, which NARP and SPARTACUS-Surface do not calculate. While
    SPARTACUS-Surface resolves multi-layer 3D radiation transfer for energy
    balance purposes, BEERS focuses on directional radiation components
    relevant to pedestrian thermal comfort at specific locations.

  performance_summary: >-
    BEERS inherits the physical basis from SOLWEIG, which has been extensively
    validated for mean radiant temperature calculations. The SUEWS-integrated
    version is under ongoing testing. Users should verify results against
    observations for their specific applications.
  intercomparison_results: >-
    SOLWEIG (predecessor) has been validated against field measurements of
    mean radiant temperature in multiple urban environments. Direct
    intercomparison of BEERS within the SUEWS framework is pending.

  configuration_notes: >-
    BEERS is a standalone diagnostic module within SUEWS. It requires building
    morphology parameters (plan area fraction, frontal area fraction) and
    surface optical properties (albedo and emissivity for ground, building,
    and wall surfaces). Location coordinates and time zone must be correctly
    specified for accurate sun position calculations.
  common_pitfalls:
    - "Incorrect building morphology parameters (lamdaP, lamdaF) leading to unrealistic view factors"
    - "Missing or incorrect location coordinates affecting sun position calculations"
    - "Confusion between SUEWS-provided surface temperature and BEERS-internal surface temperature"
