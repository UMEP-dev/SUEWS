# CI/GitHub Actions Conventions

Patterns and guidelines for GitHub Actions workflows in this repository.

---

## Fork PR Security

GitHub's security model prevents forks from obtaining OIDC tokens for `pull_request` events. This affects deployment actions like `actions/deploy-pages@v4`.

**Fork Detection Pattern:**

```yaml
- name: Check if PR is from fork
  id: fork-check
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  run: |
    if [ "${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}" != "${{ github.repository }}" ]; then
      echo "is_fork=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      echo "::notice::PR from fork detected - deployment will be skipped"
    else
      echo "is_fork=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi
```

**Conditional Step Execution:**

```yaml
- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  if: steps.fork-check.outputs.is_fork != 'true'
  uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

---

## Workflow Re-run Behaviour

Re-running a GitHub Actions workflow uses the **same workflow file version** from the original run. To apply updated workflow logic:

- Rebase the PR branch onto the target branch
- Push a new commit
- Close and reopen the PR

**Avoid**: Assuming re-runs pick up latest workflow changes from master.

---

## Fork PR Feedback

When deployment is skipped for fork PRs, provide clear feedback via PR comments:

```yaml
- name: Comment on fork PR
  if: steps.fork-check.outputs.is_fork == 'true'
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  continue-on-error: true  # Token limitations on fork PRs
  with:
    script: |
      github.rest.issues.createComment({
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        issue_number: context.issue.number,
        body: '**Note:** GitHub Pages deployment was skipped because this PR is from a fork. This is a GitHub security restriction. You can test the docs locally with `make docs`.'
      })
```

Use `continue-on-error: true` due to potential token limitations on fork PRs.

## Maintainer Workflow Patterns

### Handling Contributor PRs

When `maintainerCanModify` is enabled on a PR, maintainers can directly rebase or push changes to the contributor's fork branch.

**Maintainer Actions:**
- Rebase to trigger fresh CI with updated workflows
- Push fixes directly to the contributor's branch
- Merge master changes before re-triggering CI

### PR Management Strategy

When fixing CI issues that affect existing PRs:

1. Create a separate PR for the workflow fix
2. Merge the fix PR first
3. Rebase the original problematic PR to trigger fresh CI
4. The rebased PR will use the corrected workflow

---

## Best Practices

- **Explicit fork detection**: Always check for fork PRs in workflows involving authenticated operations
- **Informative feedback**: Explain why actions are skipped (GitHub security, token limitations)
- **Avoid hardcoded assumptions**: Don't assume all PRs have the same permissions
- **Test locally first**: Fork contributors should test locally before relying on CI

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Assuming `id-token: write` works for fork PRs
- Re-running workflows expecting new logic to apply
- Silent failures without user feedback
- Blocking fork PRs entirely when only deployment is affected
