      Calculates net all-wave radiation (Q*) from incoming shortwave radiation, air temperature, humidity, and surface characteristics using empirical longwave parameterisations.

      ``NetRadiationMethod`` = 1, 2, 3

Recommendation
--------------

**narp**: Standard urban energy balance simulations at neighbourhood scale; Long-duration runs where computational efficiency is important; Applications where observed longwave down radiation is available
