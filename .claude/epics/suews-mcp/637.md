# Task: Core SuPy Tools

## Description
Implement the essential wrapper tools that provide direct mappings to core SuPy functions. These tools form the primary interface for running SUEWS simulations through the MCP server, including simulation configuration, execution, and results analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] configure_simulation tool implemented with parameter validation
- [x] run_simulation tool with proper error handling and progress tracking
- [x] analyze_results tool for output data processing
- [x] Parameter translation between MCP and SuPy formats
- [x] Comprehensive error messages and logging
- [x] Integration tests with actual SUEWS benchmark data

## Technical Details
- Implement MCP tool handlers for each core function
- Create parameter mapping layer between MCP JSON and SuPy Python objects
- Add validation for simulation parameters and forcing data
- Implement progress callbacks for long-running simulations
- Handle SuPy exceptions and convert to MCP-appropriate responses
- Support for both quick runs and detailed configuration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: MCP Server Setup completed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [x] Code implemented
- [x] Tests written and passing
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Code reviewed
