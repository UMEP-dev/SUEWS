Version 2026.1.28 (released on 28 January 2026)
------------------------------------------------

This release focuses on stability improvements for QGIS/UMEP users, physics corrections, and executable documentation.

**Notable Changes:**

- **QGIS Crash Fix**: Resolved a long-standing issue where SUEWS crashed QGIS mid-run. Stdout writes (``PRINT *``, ``WRITE(*,*)``) that conflicted with QGIS output handling have been removed and replaced with structured warnings. This also improves thread safety for parallel simulations. (:pr:`1086`, :pr:`1083`)

- **QGIS/UMEP Test Suite**: Added comprehensive compatibility tests to catch QGIS integration issues before release. (:pr:`905`)

- **Executable Documentation**: Tutorial examples now run during documentation builds via sphinx-gallery, ensuring code examples stay current. (:pr:`1057`)

**Physics Fixes:**

- Fixed biogenic CO2 (FcRespi) to use local climate instead of global average temperature (:pr:`1117`)
- Fixed uninitialised NumCapita causing NaN values in CO2 flux calculations (:pr:`1053`)
- Reset error flag before kernel calls to prevent stale errors across runs (:pr:`1109`)

**Other Improvements:**

- Pandas 3.0 forward compatibility (:pr:`1106`)
- Improved validation ranges for albedo and emissivity (:pr:`978`, :pr:`979`)
- Structured error handling with detailed validation reports (:pr:`1070`)
- Vendored f90wrap runtime to eliminate pip dependency conflicts (:pr:`963`)

**Breaking Changes:**

None. This release maintains full backward compatibility with 2025.11.20.
