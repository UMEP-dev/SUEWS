    0: Uses values provided in the meteorological forcing file (SSss_YYYY_data_tt.txt) to calculate QF. If you do not want to include QF to the calculation of surface energy balance, you should set values in the meteorological forcing file to zero to prevent calculation of QF. UMEP provides two methods to calculate QF LQF which is simpler GQF which is more complete but requires more data inputs

    1: Method according to Loridan et al. (2011): SAHP. QF calculated using linear relation with air temperature. Weekday/weekend differences due to profile only. Scales with population density. Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file. CO2 emission is not calculated

    2: Method according to Järvi et al. (2011): SAHP_2. QF calculated using HDD and CDD. Weekday/weekend differences due to profile and coefficients QF_a,b,c. Scales with population density. Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file. CO2 emission is not calculated

    3: Updated Loridan et al. (2011) method using daily (not instantaneous) air temperature using coefficients specified. Linear relation with air temperature. Weekday/weekend differences due to profile only. Scales with population density. CO2 emission is not calculated

    4: Järvi et al. (2019) method, in addition to anthropogenic heat due to building energy use calculated by Järvi et al. (2011), that due to metabolism and traffic is also calculated using coefficients specified and diurnal patterns specified. Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file. CO2 emission is not calculated

    5: QF calculated using EmissionMethod = 4. Fc (both biogenic and anthropogenic) components calculated following Järvi et al. (2019). Emissions from traffic and human metabolism calculated as a bottom up approach using coefficients specified and diurnal patterns specified. Building emissions are calculated with the aid of heating and cooling degree days. Biogenic emissions and sinks are calculated using coefficients specified
