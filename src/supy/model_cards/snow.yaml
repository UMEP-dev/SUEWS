  purpose: >-
    Controls snow accumulation, melt, and albedo effects on the surface
    energy balance.

  theoretical_basis: >-
    When enabled, the snow module tracks snow accumulation, snowmelt, and
    snow-covered fraction for each surface type. Snow affects the surface
    albedo, roughness length, and energy balance partitioning. Snowmelt is
    driven by available energy and air temperature following a
    degree-day-plus-energy approach (Jarvi et al. 2014).
  key_publications:
    - "J14"
  key_assumptions:
    - "Snow is distributed across all surface types according to precipitation partitioning"
    - "Snowmelt rate is controlled by available energy and degree-day parameters"
  comparison_to_established: >-
    A simple toggle for SUEWS snow processes. When disabled (0), all
    precipitation is treated as liquid regardless of temperature.

evaluation_evidence:
  evaluation_status: peer-reviewed
  performance_summary: >-
    Validated against Helsinki and other high-latitude urban sites where
    snow processes are significant (Jarvi et al. 2014).

  configuration_notes: >-
    SnowUse=0 disables snow processes entirely. SnowUse=1 enables full snow
    accumulation, melt, and albedo effects.
