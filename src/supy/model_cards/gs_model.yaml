    Selects the stomatal conductance parameterisation used for the Jarvis-type
    surface resistance in the Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration calculation.

    Stomatal conductance controls the surface resistance for latent heat flux
    in the Penman-Monteith framework. The Jarvis-type model multiplies a
    maximum conductance by dimensionless stress functions for solar radiation,
    temperature, vapour pressure deficit, and soil moisture. Method 1
    (Jarvi et al. 2011) uses the original parameterisation. Method 2
    (Ward et al. 2016) provides updated temperature and VPD response
    functions with improved performance for a wider range of urban sites.

    - "Stress functions are independent of each other"

evaluation_evidence:
  evaluation_status: peer-reviewed
  performance_summary: >-
    Both parameterisations validated against urban flux tower data. Ward (2016)
    provides improved fit across a broader range of climatic conditions.
