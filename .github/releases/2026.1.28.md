## What's New

### Stability for QGIS Users

QGIS users know the frustration: a long SUEWS run crashes mid-way, losing hours of computation. This release eliminates several crash sources. We removed stdout writes that conflicted with QGIS's output handling (#1086), fixed thread-safety issues in parallel runs (#1083), and added a comprehensive QGIS/UMEP test suite to catch these problems before they reach you (#905).

### Physics Corrections

Two CO2 flux calculations now work correctly:
- **Biogenic CO2**: FcRespi (ecosystem respiration) now uses local temperature instead of a global average—critical for regional studies where climate varies across your domain (#1117)
- **Population scaling**: NumCapita initialisation fixed, eliminating NaN values in anthropogenic CO2 calculations (#1053)

### Executable Documentation

Documentation you can run. Sphinx-gallery now powers executable tutorial examples that generate their own output and plots during documentation builds, so the examples you read are always up-to-date with the code. (#1057)

### Other Improvements

- Pandas 3.0 forward compatibility (#1106)
- Improved validation ranges for albedo and emissivity (#978, #979)
- Vendored f90wrap runtime to eliminate pip dependency conflicts (#963)

### No Breaking Changes

Your existing SUEWS configurations and scripts work unchanged. Upgrade with confidence.
