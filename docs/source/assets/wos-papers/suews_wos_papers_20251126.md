**Authors**: Luo, Wen-Rong, Che, Hui-Zheng, Miao, Shi-Guang et al.
**Journal**: ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH (2025)

> The urban neighborhood serves as the fundamental unit for fine-scale management of urban carbon emissions, playing a critical role in achieving urban carbon neutrality and sustainable development. Carbon source-sink data at the urban neighborhood scale exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity, and accurate estimation of CO2 fluxes helps to better understand the relationship between urban carbon processes and both anthropogenic and natural factors. This study employed multi-source data and the S...

### 3. Direct CO2 emissions and uptake at neighbourhood-scale across the urban area of Beijing
**Authors**: Zheng, Yingqi, Havu, Minttu, Liu, Huizhi et al.
**Journal**: CITY AND ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS (2025)

> Urban areas are significant contributors to global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, highlighting the need to comprehend CO2 flux dynamics within cities for effective climate change mitigation. Neighbourhood-scale assessments of land-atmosphere CO2 exchange are needed due to the intricate interactions between human activities, infrastructure, and vegetation. In this study, surface CO2 flux (Scope 1 direct emissions) was modelled over the urban area of the megacity Beijing, China, in 2016 at 500-m ...

### 4. Compound urban heat risk revealed by co-location of social vulnerability and elevated temperatures in London, UK: A spatial analysis
**Authors**: Roberts, Emma, Sun, Ting, Pelling, Mark
**Journal**: SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY (2025)

> Heatwaves are worsening globally under climate change, with significant impacts on human health. Cities are at increased risk due to the urban heat island effect, and vulnerable populations are more likely to experience morbidity and mortality from extreme heat. Improved modelling of social vulnerability is needed in urban areas to better plan for worsening heatwaves and their public health impacts. This study performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on fifteen heat-health vulnerability indic...

### 5. Reanalysis-data-based approach to generate urban local weather data to support building energy design in a tropical climate
**Authors**: Zheng, Xing, Meili, Naika, Li, Shuyang et al.
**Journal**: SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY (2025)

> Accurate weather data is essential for building energy modeling (BEM), yet the actual urban local weather condition is often overlooked. This study developed an approach to generate local weather data using ERA5, a global atmospheric reanalysis dataset as input for two urban land surface models, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&C) and Urban Weather Generator (UWG). The generated datasets (UT&C-ERA5 and UWG-ERA5) are compared to locally measured weather data for a university campus in Singapore. Results ...

### 6. Barriers to urban hydrometeorological simulation: a review
**Authors**: Chen, Xuan, van der Werf, Job Augustijn, Droste, Arjan et al.
**Journal**: HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES (2025)

> Urban areas, characterized by dense populations and many socioeconomic activities, increasingly suffer from floods, droughts and heat stress due to land use and climate change. Traditionally, the urban thermal environment and water resource management have been studied separately, using urban land-surface models (ULSMs) and urban hydrological models (UHMs). However, as our understanding deepens and the urgency to address future climate disasters grows, it becomes clear that hydroclimatological e...

### 7. Intercomparison of biogenic CO2 flux models in four urban parks in the city of Zurich
**Authors**: Stagakis, Stavros, Brunner, Dominik, Li, Junwei et al.
**Journal**: BIOGEOSCIENCES (2025)

> Quantifying the capacity and dynamics of urban carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and carbon sequestration is becoming increasingly relevant in the development of integrated monitoring systems for urban greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There are multiple challenges in achieving these goals, such as the partitioning of atmospheric measurements of CO2 fluxes to anthropogenic and biospheric processes, the insufficient understanding of urban biospheric processes, and the applicability of existing biosphe...

### 8. Parameterizing urban canopy radiation transfer using three-dimensional urban morphological parameters
**Authors**: Mei, Shuo-Jun, Chen, Guanwen, Wang, Kai et al.
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2025)

> The radiative schemes in urban canopy models are typically based on the two-dimensional street canyon model, which cannot fully capture the three-dimensional geometries in East Asia cities. This study addresses this limitation by parameterizing radiative flux by three-dimensional urban morphology parameters: frontal area density (lambda(f)) and plan area density (lambda(p)). The parameterization is supported by simulation results from the newly developed building-resolving radiative model (PyUra...

### 9. A global urban tree leaf area index dataset for urban climate modeling
**Authors**: Dong, Wenzong, Yuan, Hua, Lin, Wanyi et al.
**Journal**: SCIENTIFIC DATA (2025)

> Urban trees are recognized for mitigating urban thermal stress, therefore incorporating their effects is crucial for urban climate research. However, due to the limitation of remote sensing, the LAI in urban areas is generally masked (e.g., MODIS), which in turn limits its application in Urban Canopy Models (UCMs). To address this gap, we developed a high-resolution (500 m) and long-time-series (2000-2022) urban tree LAI dataset derived through the Random Forest model trained with MODIS LAI data...

### 10. Carbon sequestration in different urban vegetation types in Southern Finland
**Authors**: Tholix, Laura, Backman, Leif, Havu, Minttu et al.
**Journal**: BIOGEOSCIENCES (2025)

> Many cities seek carbon neutrality and are therefore interested in the sequestration potential of urban vegetation. However, the heterogeneous nature of urban vegetation and environmental conditions limits comprehensive measurement efforts, setting expectations for carbon cycle modelling. In this study, we examined the performance of three models - the Jena Scheme for Biosphere-Atmosphere Coupling in Hamburg (JSBACH), the Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS), and the Surface...

Utilizing the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEW...

### 12. SLUCM+BEM (v1.0): a simple parameterisation for dynamic anthropogenic heat and electricity consumption in WRF-Urban (v4.3.2)
**Authors**: Takane, Yuya, Kikegawa, Yukihiro, Nakajima, Ko et al.
**Journal**: GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT (2024)

> We propose a simple dynamic anthropogenic heat (QF) parameterisation for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM). The SLUCM is a remarkable physically based urban canopy model that is widely used. However, a limitation of SLUCM is that it considers a statistically based diurnal pattern of QF. Consequently, QF is not affected by outdoor temperature changes, and the diurnal pattern of QF is constant throughout the simulation period. To address these limit...

### 13. Could residential air-source heat pumps exacerbate outdoor summer overheating and winter overcooling in UK 2050s climate scenarios?
**Authors**: Xie, Xiaoxiong, Luo, Zhiwen, Grimmond, Sue et al.
**Journal**: SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY (2024)

> The UK government promotes heat pumps to replace gas boilers in the residential sector as a vital part of its strategy to achieve Net Zero by 2050. As climate change intensifies, heat pumps, traditionally used for heating, will also play a role in cooling to address indoor heat risks that threaten public health and increase energy demands. However, air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) might unintentionally exacerbate summer overheating and winter overcooling in residential neighbourhoods. This study us...

### 14. An urban module coupled with the Variable Infiltration Capacity model to improve hydrothermal simulations in urban systems
**Authors**: Wang, Yibing, Xie, Xianhong, Zhu, Bowen et al.
**Journal**: GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT (2024)

> Global urban expansion has altered surface aerodynamics and hydrothermal dynamics, aggravating environmental challenges such as urban heat and urban dry islands. To identify such environmental responses, various physical models, including urban canyon models (UCMs) and land surface models (LSMs), have been developed to represent surface hydrothermal processes. However, UCMs often treat a city as a unified entity and overlook subcity heterogeneity. LSMs are generally designed for natural land cov...

### 15. Simulating urban surface energy balance of an academic campus and surroundings in Mumbai, India
**Authors**: Gupta, Mayank, Murtugudde, Raghu, Ghosh, Subimal
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2024)

> In evaluating the impacts of climate and urbanization on urban climates, a comprehensive understanding of surface energy balance at the local scale is imperative. However, such assessments for rapidly growing Indian cities have been hindered by limited studies on energy and water balance, primarily due to the absence of flux observations in urban regions and challenges in incorporating city-specific information into existing models. In this study, we employed the Surface Urban Energy and Water B...

### 16. Contrasting the features and functionalities of urban microclimate simulation tools
**Authors**: Vurro, Giandomenico, Carlucci, Salvatore
**Journal**: ENERGY AND BUILDINGS (2024)

> The impact of human activities on climate change has become increasingly evident, with cities being particularly vulnerable to its effects. Anthropogenic emissions, such as heat and greenhouse gases, are projected to intensify climate-induced phenomena, which can lead to negative health outcomes. To understand how human health would be affected by such climate-exacerbated phenomena, computational models that consider the local microclimate are essential to better regulate cities to respond to th...

### 17. Evaluation of surface urban energy and water balance scheme (SUEWS) using scaled 2D model experiments under various seasons and sky conditions
**Authors**: Hang, Jian, Zeng, Liyue, Shi, Yurong et al.
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2024)

In this study, the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) is evaluated using scaled outdoor experiments of idealized city models consisting of street canyons (aspect ratio H/W = 2, H = 0.5) and hollow concrete building models, under various seasonal and sky conditions in a humid subtropical climate in 2020, using three evaluation approaches. The...

### 18. CO2 uptake of urban vegetation in a warming Nordic city
**Authors**: Havu, Minttu, Kulmala, Liisa, Lee, Hei Shing et al.
**Journal**: URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING (2024)

> Many cities are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and reducing air temperatures through climate actions. Maintaining or increasing carbon sinks in urban green areas is relevant, as the sinks compensate a part of the emissions in addition to reducing emissions themselves. This research assesses the magnitude of carbon dioxide (CO2) net uptake (i.e. respiration and CO2 uptake by photosynthesis) and local 2-m air temperature in Helsinki, Finland, using an urban ...

### 19. Spatial and temporal variation of anthropogenic heat emissions in Colombo, Sri Lanka
**Authors**: Blunn, Lewis, Xie, Xiaoxiong, Grimmond, Sue et al.
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2024)

> Anthropogenic heat emissions (AHEs) should be accounted for when making city, neighbourhood, and building scale decisions about building design, health preparedness (e.g. heat stress), and achieving net zero carbon. Therefore, datasets with spatial and temporal variations are required for the range of global cities, including lower-middle income, low-latitude cities. Here we estimate the 2020 AHEs at 100 m resolution for Colombo, Sri Lanka. The city-wide annual mean is 5.9 W m(-2). Seasonal vari...

**Authors**: Briegel, Ferdinand, Wehrle, Jonas, Schindler, Dirk et al.
**Journal**: GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT (2024)

> As the frequency and intensity of heatwaves will continue to increase in the future, accurate and high-resolution mapping and forecasting of human outdoor thermal comfort in urban environments are of great importance. This study presents a machine-learning-based outdoor thermal comfort model with a good trade-off between computational cost, complexity, and accuracy compared to common numerical urban climate models. The machine learning approach is basically an emulation of different numerical ur...

Fluxes and mixed-layer height observations in the southern UK are used to evaluate a 2-week period in each season. Mean absolute errors, based on all periods, are smaller in residential Swindon than central London for turbulent sensible and latent heat...

### 22. A study of the impact of landscape heterogeneity on surface energy fluxes in a tropical climate using SUEWS
**Authors**: Obe, Oluwafemi Benjamin, Morakinyo, Tobi Eniolu, Mills, Gerald
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2024)

> This study employs an evaluated Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) model driven by Local Climate Zone (LCZ)-derived urban canopy parameters to explore landscape heterogeneity's impacts on the partitioning of surface energy fluxes and heat stress variations in Lagos, Nigeria. The results reveal that LCZ-based SUEWS effectively replicates the diurnal patterns of air temperature (Tair), relative humidity (RH), and land surface temperature (LST). The root mean square error (RMSE) ...

### 23. Evaluation of vertically resolved longwave radiation in SPARTACUS-Urban 0.7.3 and the sensitivity to urban surface temperatures
**Authors**: Stretton, Megan A., Morrison, William, Hogan, Robin J. et al.
**Journal**: GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT (2023)

> Cities' materials and urban form impact radiative exchanges and surface and air temperatures. Here, the SPARTACUS (Speedy Algorithm for Radiative Transfer through Cloud Sides) multi-layer approach to modelling longwave radiation in urban areas (SPARTACUS-Urban) is evaluated using the explicit DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) model. SPARTACUS-Urban describes realistic 3D urban geometry statistically rather than assuming an infinite street canyon. Longwave flux profiles are compared ...

### 24. Surface energy balance fluxes in a suburban area of Beijing: energy partitioning variability
**Authors**: Dou, Junxia, Grimmond, Sue, Miao, Shiguang et al.
**Journal**: ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS (2023)

> Measurements of radiative and turbulent heat fluxes for 16 months in suburban Miyun with a mix of buildings and agriculture allows the changing role of these fluxes to be assessed. Daytime turbulent latent heat fluxes (Q(E)) are largest in summer and smaller in winter, consistent with the net all-wave radiation (Q*), whereas the daytime sensible heat flux (Q(H)) is greatest in spring but smallest in summer rather than in winter, as commonly observed in suburban areas. The results have larger sea...

### 25. Human heat health index (H3I) for holistic assessment of heat hazard and mitigation strategies beyond urban heat islands
**Authors**: Kamath, Harsh G., Martilli, Alberto, Singh, Manmeet et al.
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2023)

> Certain urban neighborhoods are more susceptible to heat than others, primarily because of the unequal distribution of imperviousness, building and vegetation morphology, social vulnerability, and anthropogenic heat release. Here, we demonstrate that using the surface urban heat island intensity obtained through remote sensing approaches to evaluate urban heat vulnerability (UHV) can be misleading due to the interannual and seasonal variability of rural land surface temper-ature (LST). We presen...

### 26. Impact of building density on natural ventilation potential and cooling energy saving across Chinese climate zones
**Authors**: Xie, Xiaoxiong, Luo, Zhiwen, Grimmond, Sue et al.
**Journal**: BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT (2023)

> Natural ventilation is an energy-efficient approach to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and air conditioning in buildings. However, traditionally weather data for building energy simulation are obtained from rural areas, which do not reflect the urban micrometeorological conditions. This study combines the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) and EnergyPlus to predict natural ventilation potential (NVP) and cooling energy saving in three idealised urban neighbourhoods ...

### 27. Simulating heat and CO2 fluxes in Beijing using SUEWS V2020b: sensitivity to vegetation phenology and maximum conductance
**Authors**: Zheng, Yingqi, Havu, Minttu, Liu, Huizhi et al.
**Journal**: GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT (2023)

> The Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) has recently been introduced to include a bottom-up approach to modeling carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and uptake in urban areas. In this study, SUEWS is evaluated against the measured eddy covariance (EC) turbulent fluxes of sensible heat (Q(H)), latent heat (Q(E)), and CO2 (FC) in a densely built neighborhood in Beijing. The model sensitivity to maximum conductance (g(max)) and leaf area index (LAI) is examined. Site-specific g(max) is...

### 28. An Urban Scheme for the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System: Global Forecasts and Residential CO2 Emissions
**Authors**: McNorton, J., Agusti-Panareda, A., Arduini, G. et al.
**Journal**: JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS (2023)

> The impact of urbanization on local weather patterns affects over half the global population. Global numerical weather prediction systems have reached a resolution at which urban conurbations can be spatially resolved, justifying their representation within land surface parameterizations with the aim of improving local predictions. Additionally, real-time atmospheric monitoring of trace gas emissions can utilize weather variables relevant for urban areas. We investigated whether a simple single-...

### 29. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization of the Single-Layer Urban Canopy Model in the Megacity of Shanghai
**Authors**: Ao, Xiangyu, Zhang, Ning
**Journal**: ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY (2022)

> In order to meet the demand of more refined urban weather forecast, it is of great practical significance to improve and optimize the single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM) suitable for the megacity of Shanghai. In this paper, based on the offline SLUCM model driven by a whole-year surface flux observation data in the Shanghai central business district, a series of parameter sensitivity tests are carried out by using the one at a time (OAT) method, the relative importance and a set of optimized...

### 30. Carbon sequestration potential of street tree plantings in Helsinki
**Authors**: Havu, Minttu, Kulmala, Liisa, Kolari, Pasi et al.
**Journal**: BIOGEOSCIENCES (2022)

> Cities have become increasingly interested in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon sequestration and storage in urban vegetation and soil as part of their climate mitigation actions. However, most of our knowledge of the biogenic carbon cycle is based on data and models from forested ecosystems, despite urban nature and microclimates differing greatly from those in natural or forested ecosystems. There is a need for modelling tools that can correctly consider temporal va...

### 31. Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (v2020a) in vegetated areas: parameter derivation and performance evaluation using FLUXNET2015 dataset
**Authors**: Omidvar, Hamidreza, Sun, Ting, Grimmond, Sue et al.
**Journal**: GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT (2022)

> To compare the impact of surface-atmosphere exchanges from rural and urban areas, fully vegetated areas (e.g. deciduous trees, evergreen trees and grass) commonly found adjacent to cities need to be modelled. Here we provide a general workflow to derive parameters for SUEWS (Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme), including those associated with vegetation phenology (via leaf area index, LAI), heat storage and surface conductance. As expected, attribution analysis of bias in SUEWS-modell...

The potential of planning interventions towards improving of urban resilience can be evaluated based on methodological approaches used in the domain of urban climate. In this study, we present how Earth Observation (EO) can be systematically used to evaluate ur...

### 33. Review of User-Friendly Models to Improve the Urban Micro-Climate
**Authors**: Jaenicke, Britta, Milosevic, Dragan, Manavvi, Suneja
**Journal**: ATMOSPHERE (2021)

> Various micro-scale models for comparing alternative design concepts have been developed in recent decades. The objective of this study is to provide an overview of current user-friendly micro-climate models. In the results, a vast majority of models identified were excluded from the review because the models were not micro-scale, lacking a user-interface, or were not available. In total, eight models met the seven-point inclusion criteria. These models were ADMS Temperature and Humidity model, ...

### 34. High resolution modeling of the impact of urbanization and green infrastructure on the water and energy balance
**Authors**: Wiegels, Rebecca, Chapa, Fernando, Hack, Jochen
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2021)

Urban Green Infrastructures (UGI) are implemented to reverse such effects. This study examines the potential of a high-resolution grid-based model to show the impact of different degrees of urban land cover. The study area was divided into 52 cells and cells were categorized into four urban degrees of urbanization. T...

### 35. Urban meteorological forcing data for building energy simulations
**Authors**: Tang, Yihao, Sun, Ting, Luo, Zhiwen et al.
**Journal**: BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT (2021)

> Despite building energy use being one of the largest global energy consumers, building energy simulations rarely take the actual local neighbourhood scale climate into account. A new globally applicable approach is proposed to support buildings energy design. ERA5 (European Centre Reanalysis version 5) data are used with SUEWS (Surface Urban Energy and Water balance Scheme) to obtain (in this example case) an urban typical meteorological year (uTMY) that is usable in building energy modelling. T...

### 36. Impact of BIPV windows on building energy consumption in street canyons: Model development and validation
**Authors**: Chen, Liutao, Zheng, Xing, Yang, Jiachuan et al.
**Journal**: ENERGY AND BUILDINGS (2021)

> Photovoltaic components have been increasingly integrated into the facades of buildings as a means to enhance their energy efficiency in recent years, yet the impact of using building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) windows in street canyons has been rarely studied due to the lack of modelling tools. In this study, we developed a new parametrization scheme for BIPV windows, and incorporated it into building energy simulations coupled with a single-layer urban canopy model. Evaluation against in-s...

### 37. Analysis of the Urban Energy Balance in Bahia Blanca (Argentina)
**Authors**: Fernandez, Maria Eugenia, Picone, Natasha, Gentili, Jorge Osvaldo et al.
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2021)

> The objective of this study is to define the effect of Bahia Blanca (Argentina) urban form and function on heat fluxes integrated in its energy balance at a local scale. The most frequent Local Climate Zones (LCZs) were identified in Bahia Blanca. Most of the LCZs are built types, corresponding to LCZ 1 and 2 in the microcenter, LCZ 3 in the macrocenter, and LCZ 6 and 9 in the city peri-urban area. The spatial distribution of Urban Energy Balance (UEB) was analyzed by calculating indices: the se...

### 38. Application of SUEWS model forced with WRF: Energy fluxes validation in urban and suburban Portuguese areas
**Authors**: Rafael, S., Martins, H., Matos, M. J. et al.
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2020)

Planning sustainable cities for the future requires not only a clear understanding of how climate change will influence urban areas but also how urban areas influence the local climate. This paper validates the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) model at an urban and a suburban site in Portugal, through five months of simulations, with forcing data fro...

### 39. Short and medium- to long-term impacts of nature-based solutions on urban heat
**Authors**: Augusto, Bruno, Roebeling, Peter, Rafael, Sandra et al.
**Journal**: SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY (2020)

> Many cities are growing and becoming more densely populated, resulting in land use changes, which promotes an increase in urban heating. Nature-based solutions (NBS) are considered sustainable, cost-effective and multi-purpose solutions for these problems. While various studies assess the effects of NBS on urban heat or urban sprawl/compaction, no studies assess their cumulative effect. The main objective of this study is to assess the short-term and medium- to long-term impacts of NBS on urban ...

### 43. A Python-enhanced urban land surface model SuPy (SUEWS in Python, v2019.2): development, deployment and demonstration
**Authors**: Sun, Ting, Grimmond, Sue
**Journal**: GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT (2019)

> Accurate and agile modelling of cities weather, climate, hydrology and air quality is essential for integrated urban services. The Surface Urban Energy and Water balance Scheme (SUEWS) is a state-of-the-art widely used urban land surface model (ULSM) which simulates urban-atmospheric interactions by quantifying the energy, water and mass fluxes. Using SUEWS as the computation kernel, SuPy (SUEWS in Python) uses a Python-based data stack to streamline the pre-processing, computation and post-proc...

### 44. Simulation of the radiative effect of haze on the urban hydrological cycle using reanalysis data in Beijing
**Authors**: Kokkonen, Tom V., Grimmond, Sue, Murto, Sonja et al.
**Journal**: ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS (2019)

> Although increased aerosol concentration modifies local air temperatures and boundary layer structure in urban areas, little is known about its effects on the urban hydrological cycle. Changes in the hydrological cycle modify surface runoff and flooding. Furthermore, as runoff commonly transports pollutants to soil and water, any changes impact urban soil and aquatic environments. To explore the radiative effect of haze on changes in the urban surface water balance in Beijing, different haze lev...

### 45. The Air-temperature Response to Green/blue-infrastructure Evaluation Tool (TARGET v1.0): an efficient and user-friendly model of city cooling
**Authors**: Broadbent, Ashley M., Coutts, Andrew M., Nice, Kerry A. et al.
**Journal**: GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT (2019)

> The adverse impacts of urban heat and global climate change are leading policymakers to consider green and blue infrastructure (GBI) for heat mitigation benefits. Though many models exist to evaluate the cooling impacts of GBI, their complexity and computational demand leaves most of them largely inaccessible to those without specialist expertise and computing facilities. Here a new model called The Air-temperature Response to Green/blue-infrastructure Evaluation Tool (TARGET) is presented. TARG...

**Journal**: JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY (2018)

> The Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) is used to investigate the impact of anthropogenic heat flux Q(F) and irrigation on surface energy balance partitioning in a central business district of Shanghai. Diurnal profiles of Q(F) are carefully derived based on city-specific hourly electricity consumption data, hourly traffic data, and dynamic population density. The Q(F) is estimated to be largest in summer (mean daily peak 236 W m(-2)). When Q(F) is omitted, the SUEWS sensible ...

### 47. Changes to the Water Balance Over a Century of Urban Development in Two Neighborhoods: Vancouver, Canada
**Authors**: Kokkonen, T. V., Grimmond, C. S. B., Christen, A. et al.
**Journal**: WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH (2018)

> Hydrological cycles of two suburban neighborhoods in Vancouver, BC, during initial urban development and subsequent urban densification (1920-2010) are examined using the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme. The two neighborhoods have different surface characteristics (as determined from aerial photographs) which impact the hydrological processes. Unlike previous studies of the effect of urbanization on the local hydrology, densification of already built lots is explored with a focus o...

### 48. Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor (UMEP): An integrated tool for city-based climate services
**Authors**: Lindberg, Fredrik, Grimmond, C. S. B., Gabey, Andrew et al.
**Journal**: ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE (2018)

> UMEP (Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor), a city-based climate service tool, combines models and tools essential for climate simulations. Applications are presented to illustrate UMEP's potential in the identification of heat waves and cold waves; the impact of green infrastructure on runoff; the effects of buildings on human thermal stress; solar energy production; and the impact of human activities on heat emissions. UMEP has broad utility for applications related to outdoor thermal co...

### 49. Sensitivity of Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) to downscaling of reanalysis forcing data
**Authors**: Kokkonen, T. V., Grimmond, C. S. B., Raty, O. et al.
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2018)

> Often the meteorological forcing data required for urban hydrological models are unavailable at the required temporal resolution or for the desired period. Although reanalysis data can provide this information, the spatial resolution is often coarse relative to cities, so downscaling is required prior to use as realistic forcing. In this study, WATCH WFDEI reanalysis data are used to force the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS). From sensitivity tests in two cities, Vancouver ...

### 50. Impact of temporal resolution of precipitation forcing data on modelled urban-atmosphere exchanges and surface conditions
**Authors**: Ward, H. C., Tan, Y. S., Gabey, A. M. et al.
**Journal**: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY (2018)

> Representative precipitation data sets are very difficult to obtain due to the inherent spatial and temporal variability of rainfall. Gridded rainfall products exist at various scales, but temporal resolution is coarse (daily or, at best, a few hours). This study demonstrates the impact of low temporal resolution precipitation forcing data (PFD) on modelled energy fluxes, runoff and surface conditions, which could have implications for a range of applications including flood forecasting, irrigat...

### 51. Assessing the impact of changes in surface cover, human behaviour and climate on energy partitioning across Greater London
**Authors**: Ward, H. C., Grimmond, C. S. B.
**Journal**: LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING (2017)

> Climate-sensitive urban design is an increasingly important consideration for city planners and policy makers. This study demonstrates the use of a biophysical model to assess the response of urban climate to various changes, including population growth, reduced energy use, urban development and urban greening initiatives. Model inputs are intentionally derived using only publicly available information and assumptions involved in collating the data are discussed. Results are summarised in terms ...

### 52. Warming effects on the urban hydrology in cold climate regions
**Authors**: Jarvi, L., Grimmond, C. S. B., McFadden, J. P. et al.
**Journal**: SCIENTIFIC REPORTS (2017)

> While approximately 338 million people in the Northern hemisphere live in regions that are regularly snow covered in winter, there is little hydro-climatologic knowledge in the cities impacted by snow. Using observations and modelling we have evaluated the energy and water exchanges of four cities that are exposed to wintertime snow. We show that the presence of snow critically changes the impact that city design has on the local-scale hydrology and climate. After snow melt, the cities return to...

### 53. The Analytical Objective Hysteresis Model (AnOHM v1.0): methodology to determine bulk storage heat flux coefficients
**Authors**: Sun, Ting, Wang, Zhi-Hua, Oechel, Walter C. et al.
**Journal**: GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT (2017)

> The net storage heat flux (Delta QS) is important in the urban surface energy balance (SEB) but its determination remains a significant challenge. The hysteresis pattern of the diurnal relation between the Delta QS and net all-wave radiation (Q*) has been captured in the Objective Hysteresis Model (OHM) parameterization of Delta QS. Although successfully used in urban areas, the limited availability of coefficients for OHM hampers its application. To facilitate use, and enhance physical interpre...

### 54. Impact of urban canopy models and external parameters on the modelled urban energy balance in a tropical city
**Authors**: Demuzere, M., Harshan, S., Jarvi, L. et al.
**Journal**: QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY (2017)

> To date, existing urban land surface models (ULSMs) have been mostly evaluated and optimized for mid-and high-latitude cities. For the first time, we provide a comparative evaluation of four ULSMs for a tropical residential neighbourhood in Singapore using directly measured energy balance components. The simulations are performed offline, for an 11 month period, using the bulk scheme TERRA URB and three models of intermediate complexity (CLM, SURFEX and SUEWS). In addition, information from thre...

### 55. Quantification and mapping of urban fluxes under climate change: Application of WRF-SUEWS model to Greater Porto area (Portugal)
**Authors**: Rafael, S., Martins, H., Marta-Almeida, M. et al.
**Journal**: ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (2017)

> Climate change and the growth of urban populations are two of the main challenges facing Europe today. These issues are linked as climate change results in serious challenges for cities. Recent attention has focused on how urban surface-atmosphere exchanges of heat and water will be affected by climate change and the implications for urban planning and sustainability. In this study energy fluxes for Greater Porto area, Portugal, were estimated and the influence of the projected climate change ev...

### 56. Modelling the biogenic CO2 exchange in urban and non-urban ecosystems through the assessment of light-response curve parameters
**Authors**: Bellucco, Veronica, Marras, Serena, Grimmond, C. Susan B. et al.
**Journal**: AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY (2017)

> The biogenic CO2 surface atmosphere exchange is investigated and linked to vegetation cover fraction for seven sites (three urban and four non-urban) in the northern hemisphere. The non-rectangular hyperbola (NRH) is used to analyse the light-response curves during period of maximum ecophysiological processes, and to develop two models to simulate biogenic vertical CO2 fluxes. First, a generalised set of NRH coefficients is calculated after linear regression analysis across urban and non-urban e...

### 57. Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS): Development and evaluation at two UK sites
**Authors**: Ward, H. C., Kotthaus, S., Jarvi, L. et al.
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2016)

> The Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) is evaluated at two locations in the UK: a dense urban site in the centre of London and a residential suburban site in Swindon. Eddy covariance observations of the turbulent fluxes are used to assess model performance over a two-year period (2011-2013). The distinct characteristics of the sites mean their surface energy exchanges differ considerably. The model suggests the largest differences can be attributed to surface cover (notably th...

### 58. Radiation fluxes in a Business District of Shanghai, China
**Authors**: Ao, Xiangyu, Grimmond, C. S. B., Liu, Dongwei et al.
**Journal**: JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY (2016)

> Radiative fluxes are key drivers of surface-atmosphere heat exchanges in cities. Here the first yearlong (December 2012-November 2013) measurements of the full radiation balance for a dense urban site in Shanghai, China, are presented, collected with a CNR4 net radiometer mounted 80 m above ground. Clear sky incoming shortwave radiation K-down arrow (median daytime maxima) ranges from 575 W m(-2) in winter to 875 W m(-2) in spring, with cloud cover reducing the daily maxima by about 160 W m(-2)....

### 59. Influence of urban resilience measures in the magnitude and behaviour of energy fluxes in the city of Porto (Portugal) under a climate change scenario
**Authors**: Rafael, S., Martins, H., Sa, E. et al.
**Journal**: SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT (2016)

> Different urban resilience measures, such as the increase of urban green areas and the application of white roofs, were evaluated with the WRF-SUEWS modelling system. The case study consists of five heat waves occurring in Porto (Portugal) urban area in a future climate scenario. Meteorological forcing and boundary data were downscaled for Porto urban area from the CMIP5 earth system model MPI-ESM, for the Representative Concentration Pathway RCP8.5 scenario. The influence of different resilienc...

### 60. Exploring historical and future urban climate in the Earth System Modeling framework: 1. Model development and evaluation
**Authors**: Li, Dan, Malyshev, Sergey, Shevliakova, Elena
**Journal**: JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS (2016)

> A number of recent studies investigated impacts of Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes (LULCC) on climate with global Earth System Models (ESMs). Yet many ESMs are still missing a representation of the most extreme form of natural landscape modification - urban settlements. Moreover, long-term (i.e., decades to century) transitions between build-up and other land cover types due to urbanization and de-urbanization have not been examined in the literature. In this study we evaluate a new urban canopy...

### 61. Linking urban climate classification with an urban energy and water budget model: Multi-site and multi-seasonal evaluation
**Authors**: Alexander, P. J., Bechtel, B., Chow, W. T. L. et al.
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2016)

> There are a number of models available for examining the interaction between cities and the atmosphere over a range of scales, from small scales - such as individual facades, buildings, neighbourhoods - to the effect of the entire conurbation itself. Many of these models require detailed morphological characteristics and material properties along with relevant meteorological data to be initialised. However, these data are difficult to obtain given the heterogeneity of built forms, particularly i...

### 62. Simulating the impact of urban development pathways on the local climate: A scenario-based analysis in the greater Dublin region, Ireland
**Authors**: Alexander, P. J., Fealy, R., Mills, G. M.
**Journal**: LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING (2016)

> In this study, the impact of different urban development scenarios on neighbourhood climate are examined. The investigation considers the relative impact differing policy/planning choices will have on the local-scale climate across a city during a typical climatological year (TCY). The aim is to demonstrate a modelling approach which couples a climate-based land classification and simple urban climate model and how this can be used to examine the impact differing urban forms and design strategie...

### 63. Seasonal surface urban energy balance and wintertime stability simulated using three land-surface models in the high-latitude city Helsinki
**Authors**: Karsisto, P., Fortelius, C., Demuzere, M. et al.
**Journal**: QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY (2016)

> The performance of three urban land-surface models, run in off-line mode, with their default external parameters, is evaluated for two distinctly different sites in Helsinki: Torni and Kumpula. The former is a dense city-centre site with 22% vegetation, while the latter is a suburban site with over 50% vegetation. At both locations the models are compared against sensible and latent heat fluxes measured using the eddy covariance technique, along with snow depth observations. The cold climate exp...

### 64. Spatial validation of an urban energy balance model using multi-temporal remotely sensed surface temperature
**Authors**: Alexander, Paul J., Fealy, Rowan, Mills, Gerald
**Journal**: 2015 JOINT URBAN REMOTE SENSING EVENT (JURSE) (2015)

> Despite a growing number of urban energy balance (UEB) model applications being undertaken within urban climate literature, the number of independent validation exercises remains very limited. This in turn has raised questions as to the value of model applications without due consideration to the models performance in space and time. The PILPS-URBAN project went some ways towards understanding the general performance of 33 UEB models and highlighted the need for careful treatment of urban and no...

### 65. Using LCZ data to run an urban energy balance model
**Authors**: Alexander, Paul John, Mills, Gerald, Fealy, Rowan
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2015)

> In recent years a number of models have been developed that describe the urban surface and simulate its climatic effects. Their great advantage is that they can be applied in environments outside the cities in which they have been developed and evaluated. Thus, they may be applied to cities in the economically developing world, which are growing rapidly, and where the results of such models may have greatest impact with respect to informing planning decisions. However, data requirements, particu...

### 66. Urban surface cover determined with airborne lidar at 2 m resolution - Implications for surface energy balance modelling
**Authors**: Nordbo, Annika, Karsisto, Petteri, Matikainen, Leena et al.
**Journal**: URBAN CLIMATE (2015)

> Urban surface cover largely determines surface-atmosphere interaction via turbulent fluxes, and its description is vital for several applications. Land-cover classification using lidar has been done for small urban areas (< 10 km(2)) whereas surface-cover maps in atmospheric modelling often have resolutions > 10 m. We classified land cover of the urban/suburban area (54 km(2)) of Helsinki into six classes based on airborne lidar data, and an algorithm for machine-learning classification trees. I...

### 67. Development of the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) for cold climate cities
**Authors**: Jarvi, L., Grimmond, C. S. B., Taka, M. et al.
**Journal**: GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT (2014)

> The Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) is developed to include snow. The processes addressed include accumulation of snow on the different urban surface types: snow albedo and density aging, snow melting and re-freezing of meltwater. Individual model parameters are assessed and independently evaluated using long-term observations in the two cold climate cities of Helsinki and Montreal. Eddy covariance sensible and latent heat fluxes and snow depth observations are available fo...

### 68. The Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS): Evaluation in Los Angeles and Vancouver
**Authors**: Jarvi, L., Grimmond, C. S. B., Christen, A.
**Journal**: JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY (2011)

> An urban energy and water balance model is presented which uses a small number of commonly measured meteorological variables and information about the surface cover. Rates of evaporation-interception for a single layer with multiple surface types (paved, buildings, coniferous trees and/or shrubs, deciduous trees and/or shrubs, irrigated grass, non-irrigated grass and water) are calculated. Below each surface type, except water, there is a single soil layer. At each time step the moisture state o...
