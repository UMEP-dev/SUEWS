    SPARTACUS-Surface (SS) uses a multi-layer description of the urban canopy
    with a statistical representation of horizontal building and vegetation
    distributions. Wall-to-wall separation distances follow an exponential
    probability distribution, from which probabilities of light interception
    by trees, walls, and the ground are determined. Trees are assumed randomly
    distributed with one or two vegetation regions per layer. Each interception
    event can produce diffuse or specular reflection, absorption, or diffuse
    transmission. Building properties are determined by albedos and
    emissivities; vegetation properties by extinction coefficients and single
    scattering albedos. The scheme supports up to 15 vertical layers with
    user-defined heights and vertically heterogeneous building and vegetation
    fractions.

  key_assumptions:
    - "Trees are randomly distributed within the canopy"
    - "Wall-to-wall separation distances follow an exponential probability distribution"
    - "Vegetation extinction coefficients are uniform across all vegetated layers"
    - "Building facet and ground temperatures equal SUEWS surface temperature (TSfc_C)"

    - "Buildings do not touch as building fraction approaches 1 (crown shyness analogy)"
  comparison_to_established: >-
    SPARTACUS-Surface provides physically-based 3D radiation transfer compared
    to NARP's bulk parameterisation. It resolves vertical heterogeneity in
    building and vegetation geometry, whereas NARP treats the surface as a
    single layer with area-weighted properties. The additional fidelity comes
    at substantially higher computational cost and data requirements.

  evaluation_datasets:
    - "Internal testing within SUEWS coupling framework"
  performance_summary: >-
    The standalone SPARTACUS-Surface library has been evaluated in vegetation
    and urban canopy contexts. The SUEWS coupling is under active testing but
    peer-reviewed validation of the coupled system has not yet been published.
  intercomparison_results: >-
    The standalone SPARTACUS-Surface model has been compared against Monte
    Carlo radiation simulations for idealised urban geometries. Coupled
    SUEWS-SS intercomparisons are pending.

  configuration_notes: >-
    NetRadiationMethod values 1001-1003 select SPARTACUS-Surface with different
    longwave down options: 1001 = observed Ldown, 1002 = modelled from cloud
    fraction, 1003 = modelled from air temperature and humidity. Requires
    SUEWS_SPARTACUS.nml in the input directory with settings for stream counts,
    vegetation regions, and radiative properties. Building and vegetation
    fractions in SUEWS_SPARTACUS.nml must be consistent with SUEWS_SiteSelect
    surface fractions.
  common_pitfalls:
    - "Inconsistent building/vegetation fractions between SUEWS_SiteSelect and SUEWS_SPARTACUS.nml"
    - "Missing or incorrectly formatted SUEWS_SPARTACUS.nml file"
    - "Using default vegetation SSA values when site-specific values are available"
