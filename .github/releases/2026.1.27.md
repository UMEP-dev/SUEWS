## What's New

Buildings breathe. They warm up during the day, release heat at night, and their occupants follow rhythms—turning on heating in the morning, cooling in the afternoon, running appliances in the evening. Until now, SUEWS modelled these patterns with static daily profiles. Version 2026.1.27 changes that.

### Dynamic Building Profiles

STEBBS now supports 10-minute resolution profiles for heating setpoints, cooling setpoints, appliance usage, occupancy, and hot water demand. This means your building energy simulations can finally capture the sharp morning ramp-up when residents wake, the midday lull, and the evening peak—patterns that matter for urban heat island studies and demand-side energy research. (#1038)

### Improved Surface Heat Storage

Different surfaces store heat differently. Roofs behave unlike roads; grass unlike concrete. The dynamic Objective Hysteresis Model (dyOHM) now calculates heat storage separately for each surface type, improving accuracy for mixed urban landscapes where surface composition varies block by block. (#1122)

### Stability for QGIS Users

QGIS users know the frustration: a long SUEWS run crashes mid-way, losing hours of computation. This release eliminates several crash sources. We removed stdout writes that conflicted with QGIS's output handling (#1086), fixed thread-safety issues in parallel runs (#1083), and added a comprehensive QGIS/UMEP test suite to catch these problems before they reach you (#905).

### Physics Corrections

Two CO₂ flux calculations now work correctly:
- **Biogenic CO₂**: FcRespi (ecosystem respiration) now uses local temperature instead of a global average—critical for regional studies where climate varies across your domain (#1117)
- **Population scaling**: NumCapita initialisation fixed, eliminating NaN values in anthropogenic CO₂ calculations (#1053)

### Future-Proofing

Pandas 3.0 brings breaking changes to Copy-on-Write behaviour and `asfreq()`. This release handles both, so your existing scripts will continue working when you upgrade Pandas (#1106).

### No Breaking Changes

Your existing SUEWS configurations and scripts work unchanged. Upgrade with confidence.
