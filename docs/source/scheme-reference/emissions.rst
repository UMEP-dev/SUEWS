      Calculates anthropogenic heat flux (QF) and associated CO2 emissions from human metabolism, building energy use, and road traffic using temperature-dependent parameterisations and diurnal activity profiles.

      ``EmissionsMethod`` = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Recommendation
--------------

**qf**: Standard urban energy balance simulations requiring anthropogenic heat; Studies where QF magnitude and diurnal pattern matter but detailed sectoral breakdown is not essential; Long-duration runs where computational efficiency is important
