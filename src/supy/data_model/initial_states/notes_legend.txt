Temperature-Related Notes (1-9):
--------------------------------
1. Parameters that are assigned with 2m monthly mean air temperature from precheck procedure.
Monthly mean air temperature is obtained from CRU dataset.

2. Snow and ice parameters that needs to be updated according to monthly mean air temperature.
If monthly mean air temperature > 4C°, these should be set to 0.


3. Snow and ice parameters that needs to be updated according to monthly mean air temperature.
If monthly mean air temperature < 4C°, these should be set to reasonable values. 
Ask Lena for suggestions.
