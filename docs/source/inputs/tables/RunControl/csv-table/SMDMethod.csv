SMD modelled using water balance and parameters specified in `SUEWS_Soil.txt`.
The model calculates soil moisture deficit based on precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff.
|Recmd| for sites without soil moisture observations.

**Important considerations:**
- Requires proper initialization of soil moisture states (soilstore_id values)
- Initial values that are too low can lead to severe water stress
- May cause FcPhoto to approach zero in summer if not properly configured
- Consider enabling irrigation (WaterUseMethod) for urban areas
- See troubleshooting guide if FcPhoto values are unexpectedly low

1,"
Observed SM provided in the meteorological forcing file is used.
Data are provided as volumetric soil moisture content (m³ water/m³ soil).
Metadata must be provided in `SUEWS_Soil.txt`.

**Advantages:**
- Bypasses internal soil water balance calculations
- More reliable for sites with good soil moisture measurements
- Recommended solution if FcPhoto issues occur with method 0
"
2,"
Observed SM provided in the meteorological forcing file is used.
Data are provided as gravimetric soil moisture content (kg water/kg dry soil).
Metadata must be provided in `SUEWS_Soil.txt`.

**Note:** The model will convert gravimetric to volumetric content using soil bulk density.
