.. note::

	The biogenic CO2 module is **experimental**. While scientifically validated against
	established photosynthesis models (rectangular/non-rectangular hyperbola, conductance-based),
	users should verify results for their specific applications.
	See :ref:`troubleshooting` for guidance on common issues with FcPhoto calculations.
