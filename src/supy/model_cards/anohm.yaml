  category: storage_heat
  purpose: >-
    Calculates storage heat flux using an analytical extension of OHM with
    coefficients derived from surface thermal properties.

scientific_basis:
  theoretical_basis: >-
    AnOHM analytically derives OHM coefficients from material thermal
    properties (thermal conductivity, heat capacity) and surface
    characteristics, avoiding the need for empirical coefficient
    calibration. The method was described in Sun et al. (2017).

  configuration_notes: >-
    StorageHeatMethod=3 selects AnOHM. This method is deprecated and not
    recommended. Use DyOHM (StorageHeatMethod=6) for dynamic coefficient
    calculation or standard OHM (StorageHeatMethod=1) for empirical
    coefficients.

governance:
  candidate_for_deprecation: true
  deprecation_rationale: >-
    Superseded by DyOHM (StorageHeatMethod=6) which provides improved
    dynamic coefficient calculation from material properties and
    meteorological conditions.
  migration_path: >-
    Migrate to DyOHM (StorageHeatMethod=6) for dynamic coefficients or
    OHM (StorageHeatMethod=1) for standard empirical coefficients.
